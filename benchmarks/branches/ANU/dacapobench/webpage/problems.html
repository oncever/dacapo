  <title>The DaCapo Benchmark Suite</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>Known Problems</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The benchmarks 'chart' and 'batik' currently do not run with
      JikesRVM (2.4.1) or Kaffe (1.1.6) for what appear to be class-library
      related issues.<p>
  </li>
  <li>The benchmarks run with the Sun jdk 1.4 and 1.5, but do not build with
      1.5.  This is a limitation of some of the benchmarks themselves.<p>
  </li>
  <li>
The jar file contains the compiled classes for the benchmark programs, plus
the minimum library jar file contents required to get the benchmarks to run.
<p>
If the system class libraries for your VM are missing classes distributed 
as library jar files with the benchmark, please let us know so we can amend
the build procedure.  After building with ant, the source tree for each 
benchmark is left in the build_src subdirectory, and comparing the library
jar files distributed with the benchmark and the dacapo build.xml might 
provide the answer.<p>
  </li>
  <li>There are some issues with JikesRVM.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>By default, JikesRVM does not build classpath with support for
AWT, which
<span style="font-style: italic;">batik</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">chart</span> use. Jikes can be configured
to use AWT, by editing <span style="font-family: monospace;">rvm/bin/jBuildClasspathJar</span>,
in particular, ensuring that the <span style="font-family: monospace;">--disable-gtk-peer</span>
argument is <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>set when
classpath is built (ie you want the gtk-peer enabled).
<p>
(Updated 10/4/05) This no longer seems to be sufficient - JikesRVM (and Kaffe 1.1.6) no longer
seem to run batik or chart even with gtk support installed.<p>
</li>
    <li>Version beta041020 did not include sufficient classes for Jikes
RVM to run xalan.&nbsp; This is fixed in subsequent releases.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
