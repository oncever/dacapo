This is the second beta release of the anticipated 2009 release of the
DaCapo benchmark suite.  These notes are structured as follows:

    1. Purpose
    2. Overview
    3. Usage
    4. Changes
    5. Known problems and limitations



1. Purpose
----------

This beta release exists specifically (and only) to allow community
feedback and contribution to the upcoming major release, and to allow
JVM vendors to test against the suite prior to the final release. We
strongly encourage the community to explore and evaluate these
benchmarks and to send feedback to the dacapo research group via the
mailing list and/or bug tracker. Please check the list of known issues
(below) before sending feedback.


   mailing list: dacapobench-researchers@lists.sourceforge.net
     (subscribe via: http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=172498)

   bug tracker:
       http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=172498&atid=861957
     or navigate to it from
       http://sourceforge.net/projects/dacapobench/develop


We are particularly interested in feedback on the following:

    o The decision to add benchmarks "avrora", "batik", "derby",
      "sunflow", "tomcat", "tradebeans", and "tradesoap" (see 4.1
      below).

    o The decision to "retire" benchmarks "antlr", "bloat", "chart",
      and "hsqldb" (see 4.2 below).

    o The tuning / running time of each of the benchmarks in their
      default settings.

    o The structure and behavior of the tradebeans, tradesoap and
      tomcat client/server benchmarks.

    o Any issues associated with building, running and usability of
      the suite.


2. Overview
-----------

The DaCapo benchmark suite is slated to be updated every few years.
The 9.10 release will be the first major update of the suite, and is
strictly incompatible with previous releases: new benchmarks have been
added, old benchmarks have been removed, all other benchmarks have
been substantially updated. It is for this reason that in any
published use of the suite, the version of the suite must be
explicitly stated.

The release sees the retirement of a number of single-threaded
benchmarks (antlr, bloat and chart), the replacement of hsqldb by
derby, the addition of six completely new benchmarks, and the upgrade
of all other benchmarks to reflect the current release state of the
applications from which the benchmarks were derived. These changes are
consistent with the original goals of the DaCapo project, which
include the desire for the suite to remain relevant and reflect the
current state of deployed Java applications.

Each of these benchmarks is tested for both performance* and
correctness nightly. Results are available here:

    o performance:  http://dacapo.anu.edu.au/regression/perf/head.html
    o sanity:  http://dacapo.anu.edu.au/regression/sanity/latest/

      * tradebeans and tradesoap are not yet running performance tests


3. Usage
--------

3.1 Downloading

  o Download the binary jar and/or source zip from:
      https://sourceforge.net/projects/dacapobench/files/
  
  o Access the source from subversion via
      svn co https://dacapobench.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dacapobench dacapobench

3.2 Running

  o Run a benchmark:
      java -jar <dacapo-jar-name>.jar <benchmark>

  o For usage information, run with no arguments.


3.3 Building

  o You must have a working, recent version of ant installed. Change
    to the benchmarks directory and then run:

       ant -p

    for instructions on how to build.


4. Changes
----------


4.1. Additions since 2006-10-MR2

      avrora: AVRORA is a set of simulation and analysis tools in a
              framework for AVR microcontrollers. The benchmark
              exhibits a great deal of fine-grained concurrency. The
              benchmark is courtesy of Ben Titzer (Sun Microsystems)
              and was developed at UCLA.

       batik: Batik is an SVG toolkit produced by the Apache foundation.
              The benchmark renders a number of svg files.

          h2: h2 is an in-memory database benchmark, using the
              h2 database produced h2dataabase.com, and executing an
              implementation of the TPC-C workload produced by the
              Apache foundation for its derby project. h2 replaces
              derby, which in turn replaced hsqldb.

     sunflow: Sunflow is a rendering system for photo-realistic images
              based on raytracing engine.

      tomcat: Tomcat uses the Apache Tomcat servelet container to run
              some sample web applications.

  tradebeans: Tradebeans runs the Apache daytrader workload "directly"
              (via EJB) within a Geronimo application server.  Daytrader
              is derived from the IBM Trade6 benchmark.

   tradesoap: Tradesoap is identical to the tradebeans workload, except
              that client/server communications is via soap protocols
              (and the workloads are reduced in size to compensate the
              substantially higher overhead).

Tradebeans and tradesoap were added as a pair specifically to allow
researchers to analyze overheads associated with the widely used soap
protocol.
             


4.2. Deletions
 
       antlr: Antlr is single threaded and highly repetitive. The
              most recent version of jython uses antlr; so antlr
              remains represented within the DaCapo suite.

       bloat: Bloat is not as widely used as our other workloads
              and the code exhibited some pathologies that were
              arguably not representive or desirable in a suite that
              was to be representive of modern Java applications.

       chart: Chart was repetitive and used a framework that appears
              not to be as widely used as most of the other DaCapo
              benchmarks.  The Batik workload has some similarities
              with chart (both are render vector graphics), but is
              part of a larger heavyly used framework from Apache.

       derby: Derby has been replaced by h2, which runs a much
              richer workload and uses a more widely used and higher
              performing database engine (derby was not in any
              previous release, but had been slated for inclusion in
              this release).

      hsqldb: Hsqldb has been replaced by h2, which runs a much
              richer workload and uses a more widely used and higher
              performing database engine.


4.3. Updates


All other benchmarks have been updated to reflect the latest release
of the underlying application.


4.4. Other Notable Changes

The packaging of the DaCapo suite has been completely re-worked and
the source code is entirely re-organized.


5. Known Issues
---------------

Please consult the bug tracker for a complete and up to date list of
known issues (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=172498&atid=861957).

DaCapo is an open source community project. We welcome all assistance
in addressing bugs and shortcomings in the suite.


A few notable high priority issues are listed here:


5.1 Concurrency

We intend to conduct a concurrency audit, analyzing and documenting
the level of concurrency in each of the workloads. The per-benchmark
documentation available at the commandline (with the -i switch) should
report the level of threading for each benchmark. Although most
benchmarks exhibit significant concurrency, we have made the conscious
decision to continue to include a few single-threaded benchmarks. We
do this because as long as there exist a significant number of single
threaded applications in popular use, the single-threaded performance
of a JVM is important. 

5.2 Tomcat

We intend to make the tomcat workload more interesting. Performance
results show that tomcat currently has a remarkably flat warm-up curve
when compared to other benchmarks.
