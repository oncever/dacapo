 - Xalan benchmark harness now closes input and output files
   explicitly.  Prevents running out of file handles in large
   heaps (where finalizers never run).
   
 - Added "-ignoreValidation" command line switch.
 
 - Changed jikesrvm stubs so that MMTk callback works with recent 
   JikesRVM releases (and hopefuly now with future JVMs that use MMTk).
