  <title>The DaCapo Benchmark Suite</title>

<h1>Known Problems</h1>

The following describes known problems with the current release of the
DaCapo benchmark suite.  We only list problems that we believe are
intrinsic to the suite.  JVM-specific problems are not listed here.

<ul>
  <li>The <b>'avrora'</b> benchmark leaks memory.  We have identified the source of the leak and passed this information on to the maintainers.   In the absence of a fix, we have elected to include the benchmark as-is because notwithstanding the leak, it represents an interesting class of application not represented elsewhere in the suite.   This bug is a 'real world' scenario and is therefore consistent with our goal of producing real-world benchmarks 'warts and all'.  This bug will not be fixed until the next major release of the suite, since a fix will change the workload and we have committed to holding workloads constant for the duraton of any given major release.
  </li>
  <li>The <b>'tradebeans'</b>, <b>'tradesoap'</b> and <b>'tomcat'</b> all use network connections very inefficiently (using netstat we have observed more than 64,000 open connections when running trade).   We believe that these problems are inherent to the workload (not our harness), so we have elected to leave them as-is.
  </li>
  <li>Some of the benchmarks <b>do not build with a 1.6 jre</b> (all will run on 1.6 JVMs).  These limitations are intrinsic to the benchmarks---we have elected to work around those limitations and require 1.5 jres at build time.   This only affects those who use the source distribution.
  </li>
  <li>Benchmark <b>validation</b> currently just uses a checksum of various outputs (including stdout, stderr, and in some cases output files).   Ideally the validation might compare against a correct version of the output and produce a diff on failure.  We were unable to add such support to the 9.12 release, but will consider it for subsequent releases.  As always, contributions are welcome!
  </li>
  <li>We no longer offer special suppport for <b>whole program static analysis</b>.  The 2006-10 release included hooks that faciliated whole program static analysis by tools such as soot.  This was generously contributed by Eric Bodden (a PhD student at McGill at the time).  Unfortunately the approach used there does not apply to the new release of the suite which uses reflection more pervasively and includes benchmarks that are much more complex and that have complex dependencies.  We welcome contributions that might help address this shortcoming.
