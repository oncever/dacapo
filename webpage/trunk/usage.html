<h1>Usage</h1>
Our suite will evolve to maintain its relevance. It is therefore
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-style: italic;"> essential that
the version number associated with the release be cited in any use of
the benchmark,</span> and we ask that you please cite the 2006 OOPSLA paper describing the suite:

<h2>Running benchmarks</h2>
Execute the jar without any arguments to get usage information:<p>
To run one of the benchmarks, use the command:<p>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">
java -jar dacapo-2006-10.jar
</span>

<h3>Guidance</h3> 

When reporting results, be sure to report the precise version of the
suite, as well as any command line arguments used.<p>

The benchmark harness allows control over the number of iterations
executed (allowing observation of the benchmark warm-up).<p>

The harness also allows the number of client (external) threads to be
controlled for many benchmarks (some benchmarks are intentionally
single-threaded).  Note that we sharply differentiate <b>internal</b>
and <b>external</b> concurrency.  The former (internal) is an
intrinsic property of the benchmark and is not user-controlable.  For
example the avrora benchmark uses threads to represent simulated
entities.  The number of threads used is a property of the system
being simulated and is not user controllable.  This is an example of
internal concurrency.  On the other hand, some benchmarks, such as
lusearch exhibit external concurrency which allows the user to define
the number of threads across which the task (or part of the task) is
partitioned.  The tradebeans and tradesoap benchmarks exhibit both
forms of concurrency, with their server components using thread pools
to manage requests (internal concurrency, not user controlable), and
while the harness specifies the number of clients which concurrently
make requests to the server (external concurrency, user controlable).
For all benchmarks that exhibit external concurrency, the level of
concurrency is by default set at the number of available processors.
This may be overriden at the command-line, either with an explicit
number of threads or with a user-specified multiplier against the
number of available processors.  It is important that you explicitly
report the number of threads used when you override the harness
defaults.

<h3>Callbacks</h3> 

The harness allows for pluggable callbacks which are executed before
and after benchmark execution.  These allow (for example) JVM-specific
statistics collection to be started and stopped.<p>

<a href="MyCallback.java">Here</a> is an example benchmark callback
class.<p>

The distributed jar file contains one pre-built callback,
<bf>MMTkCallback</bf>, which brackets the timing run with calls to
MMTk's benchmark harness.  <br>
