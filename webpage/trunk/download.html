  <title>The DaCapo Benchmark Suite</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Download</h1>
To use the suite, all you need is the dacapo jar, which can be
downloaded <a target="_foo" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=172498">here</a>
(69MB).<p>
We have a source distribution available <a target="_foo" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=172498">here</a>
(6 MB).&nbsp; 
To build the dacapo jar from these sources you will need the apache 'ant' tool -
 see the supplied README file for details.
<p>
This contains the DaCapo benchmark software but none of the third-party software.  The ant task 'sources' downloads the required packages.

<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">NEW</span> Since January 2007, we have made <a target="_foo" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=172498">available</a> a binary distribution for use by those doing ahead of time static analysis with tools such as <a href="http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot">Soot</a>.  Note that this is <b>not</b> recommended for other users, as the standard jar file remains the simplest, and standard way to run the DaCapo benchmarks.  Please only use the new 'deps' release if you know what you're doing.  The new 'deps' distribution consists of a zip archive containing two jar files for each benchmark, one, <tt>&lt;bm&gt;.jar</tt> containing the core classes for the given benchmark, and the other, <tt>&lt;bm&gt;-deps.jar</tt> containing the external dependencies for the benchmark <tt>bm</tt>.  Look <a href="soot.html>here</a> for further discussion of using the DaCapo suite with ahead-of-time analyzers such as Soot.
