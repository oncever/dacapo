  <title>The DaCapo Benchmark Suite</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Overview</h1>

This benchmark suite is intended as a tool for Java benchmarking 
by the programming language, memory management and computer architecture communities.  It consists of a set 
of <span style="font-style: italic;">open source</span>,  
<span style="font-style: italic;">real world</span> 
applications with non-trivial memory loads.  The suite is the culmination of over five years work at eight institutions, as part of the  <a href="http://www.dacapo-group.org" target="_foo">DaCapo research project</a>, which was funded by a National Science Foundation ITR Grant, CCR-0085792.

<h2>News</h2>

<ul>
<b><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">NEW (Jan 23, 2007) </span></b>With assistance from Chris Kulla, we have a draft of a new <a href="http://sunflow.sourceforge.net/">SunFlow</a> benchmark in our subversion repository as a <i>candidate</i> for inclusion in the DaCapo suite.   To evaluate the benchmark, grab the svn head ("<tt>svn co https://dacapobench.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dacapobench/benchmarks/trunk dacapo</tt>"), build the sunfow benchmark ("<tt>cd dacapo/benchmarks; ant sunflow.source clean sunflow jar.quick</tt>"), then run it ("<tt>java -jar dacapo.jar sunflow</tt>").  SunFlow, along with other candidates, will be evaluated over the next 6-12 months for possible inclusion in the next release of the suite.  Note that SunFlow requires Java 1.5 or later.<p>
<b>(Dec 26, 2006)</b> A minor maintenance release (dacapo-2006-10-MR1) is now <a href="download.html">available</a>. This includes a bug fix and minor enhancements to the interface.  The workloads are <i>unchanged</i>.  See <a href="news.html" target="MAIN">news</a> for a list of past news.
</ul>

<h2>Plans</h2>

<ul>
With the release of dacapo-2006-10, we have begun working toward the next major release of the suite, which we anticipate will appear in the second half of 2007.  We will make beta releases prior to that.
<ul>
<li>We have started examining <i>new benchmarks</i> for potential inclusion in the next release.  The first new benchmark to be proposed is <a href="http://sunflow.sourceforge.net/">SunFlow</a>.  We hope to commence evaluation during November 2006, in cooperation with the SunFlow maintainer.  This benchmark came to our attention via an external nomination.  If there are other benchmarks people would like to be considered, please contact us via the mailing list.
<li>We are also looking at improving and possibly removing existing workloads.  Please use the mailing list if you have suggestions for improving the existing benchmarks.
<li>We are considering a new workload which will run multiple benchmarks concurrently (simulating a multi-application concurrent workload).
</ul><br>
Our suite will evolve to maintain its relevance. It is therefore <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">essential that
the version number associated with the release be cited in any use of
the benchmark,</span> and we ask that you please cite the 2006 OOPSLA paper describing the suite:
