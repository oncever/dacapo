  <title>The DaCapo Benchmark Suite</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Overview</h1>

This benchmark suite is intended as a tool for Java benchmarking 
by the programming language, memory management and computer architecture communities.  It consists of a set 
of <span style="font-style: italic;">open source</span>,  
<span style="font-style: italic;">real world</span> 
applications with non-trivial memory loads.  The suite is the culmination of over five years work at eight institutions, as part of the  <a href="http://www-ali.cs.umass.edu/DaCapo/index.html" target="_foo">DaCapo research project</a>, which was funded by a National Science Foundation ITR Grant, CCR-0085792.

<h2>News</h2>

<ul><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">NEW: </span>A new beta release of the suite is available for <a href="download.html">download</a> and evaluation (version <b>beta-2006-10</b>). <i>New features for beta-2006-10 include:</i></li>
<ol>
    <li><b>The <span style="font-family:monospace;">xalan</span> benchmark has been re-written. </b>This version has a more realistic workload. We also force the use of version 2.4.1 and ensure that xalan is used (rather than a bundled xslt processor). [Thanks to Kev Jones of Intel!]</li>
    <li><b>The validation mechanism has been completely overhauled</b>.  The validation mechanism ensures that benchmarks only "PASS" if they complete correctly. The harness should now work properly on any OS, and deals with the users' pwd which creeps into some benchmark output. [Thanks to Robin Garner of ANU!]</li>
    <li><b>The <span style="font-family:monospace;">lusearch</span> benchmark has been improved</b>, so that each query thread includes a mix of unique and shared queries (previously all queries were unique/non-shared).</li>
    <li><b>The build system has been improved </b>considerably and is a little better documented.</li>
  </ol>
</ul>

<h2>Plans</h2>

<ul>
<li>We will make our first full release by October 24, in time for our OOPSLA presentation of the suite and accompanying paper.
</ul>

Our suite will evolve to maintain its relevance. It is therefore <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">essential that
the version number associated with the release be cited in any use of
the benchmark,</span> and we ask that you please cite the 2006 OOPSLA paper describing the suite:
