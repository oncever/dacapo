  <title>The DaCapo Benchmark Suite</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Overview</h1>

This benchmark suite is intended as a tool for Java benchmarking 
by the programming language, memory management and computer architecture communities.  It consists of a set 
of <span style="font-style: italic;">open source</span>,  
<span style="font-style: italic;">real world</span> 
applications with non-trivial memory loads.  The suite is the culmination of over five years work at eight institutions, as part of the  <a href="http://www.dacapo-group.org" target="_foo">DaCapo research project</a>, which was funded by a National Science Foundation ITR Grant, CCR-0085792.
<p>
Our suite evolves to maintain its relevance. It is therefore <i>essential that
you <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">cite the version number</span> associated with the release</i> in any use of
the benchmark, and as a courtesy to the developers, we ask that you <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">please cite the paper</span> from OOPSLA 2006 describing the suite:

<h2>News</h2>

<ul>

<b><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">NEW</span> Nov 19, 2008</b> In anticipation of the upcoming release, we have created a <a href="todo.html" target="MAIN">TODO list</a> of work that needs to be done before the upcoming release.  Please send email to the mailing list or directly to Steve Blackburn if you think you can help.<p>

<b><span style="color: rgb(0, 180, 0);">COMING SOON</span> July 23, 2008</b> As part of the up-coming release, we are working hard on a first draft of a new workload based on the DayTrader app-server workload. Please contact Steve Blackburn directly if you are interested in contributing to the design and testing of this workload.<p>

See <a href="news.html" target="MAIN">news</a> for a list of past news.

<h2>Plans</h2>

<ul>
Since the release of dacapo-2006-10, we have been working toward the next major release of the suite, currently scheduled to appear in <b>October 2008</b>.  We plan to make beta releases in the coming months.
<ul>
<li>We are examining <i>new benchmarks</i> for potential inclusion in the next release.  The first new benchmark to be proposed was <a href="http://sunflow.sourceforge.net/">SunFlow</a>.  We finished a first cut implementation in late 2006.  Sunflow and all other candidate workloads are evaluated in our <a href="http://dacapo.anu.edu.au/regression/perf/head.html"/>continuous</a> regressions of our development head.  This benchmark came to our attention via an external nomination.
<li> We have also started evaluating Apache <a href="http://geronimo.apache.org"/>Geronimo</a> and its <a href="http://cwiki.apache.org/GMOxDOC20/daytrader.html">DayTrader</a> benchmark. If there are other benchmarks people would like to be considered, please contact us via the <a href="lists.html">mailing list</a>.
<li>We are continually looking at improving and possibly removing existing workloads.  Please use the mailing list if you have suggestions for improving the existing benchmarks.
<li>We are considering a new workload which will run multiple benchmarks concurrently (simulating a multi-application concurrent workload).
