  <title>The DaCapo Benchmark Suite</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Overview</h1>

This benchmark suite is intended as a tool for Java benchmarking 
by the programming language, memory management and computer architecture communities.  It consists of a set 
of <span style="font-style: italic;">open source</span>,  
<span style="font-style: italic;">real world</span> 
applications with non-trivial memory loads.  The initial release of the suite was the culmination of over five years work at eight institutions, as part of the  <a href="http://www.dacapo-group.org" target="_foo">DaCapo research project</a>, which was funded by a National Science Foundation ITR Grant, CCR-0085792.   Two and half years of development have gone into the upcoming 2009 release.  This work has been funded by the ANU, the Australian Research Council and a generous donation from Intel.
<p>
Our suite evolves to maintain its relevance. It is therefore <i>essential that
you <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">cite the version number</span> associated with the release</i> in any use of
the benchmark, and as a courtesy to the developers, we ask that you <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">please cite the paper</span> from OOPSLA 2006 describing the suite:

<h2>News</h2>

<ul>
<b><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">NEW </span>Oct 23, 2009</b>  We have just made a second beta release of the forthcoming major revision.  Note that this release is <i>not</i> suitable as a research tool; we have made the release <i>only</i>. Please be sure to read the <a href="RELEASE_NOTES.txt">release notes</a> before using this release.  It is available <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=172498">here</a>.  Notable updates include replacement of the derby benchmark with h2, which uses the <a href="http://www.h2database.com">h2</a> database engine and a TPC-C-based workload, and major improvements to tradebeans and tradesoap, so they now run reliably.  Our next steps include refinements to the harness and fine tuning of the workloads.  Please use the project's <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=172498&atid=861957">trackers</a> or <a href="lists.html"> mailing lists</a> for your feedback.<p>

<b>Sep 12, 2009</b> Three years after our last major release, we have <i>finally</i> made a beta release of the next major version of the suite.  This release is <i>not</i> suitable as a research tool; we have made the release <i>only</i> to garner community feedback in anticipation of a major release in October.  We encourage JVM developers to start testing their JVMs against this beta release.  We encourage those interested in the suite's composition to evaluate and offer feedback on this release.   We particularly encourage those interested in app server workloads to evaluate this release.  Please be sure to read the <a href="RELEASE_NOTES.txt">release notes</a> before using this release.  It is available <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=172498">here</a>.

<h2>Plans</h2>

<ul>
Since the release of dacapo-2006-10, we have been working toward the next major release of the suite, currently scheduled to appear in <b>October 2009</b>.  We plan to make multiple beta releases in the weeks prior to the major release.
<ul>
<li>We are continually looking at improving and possibly removing existing workloads.  Please use the mailing list if you have suggestions for improving the existing benchmarks.
