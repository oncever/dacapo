   10:13: There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.
   10:14: Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
   10:15: I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
   10:16: The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
   10:17: For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.
   10:18: Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
   10:19: What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?
   10:20: But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.
   10:21: Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.
   10:22: Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
   10:23: All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.
   10:24: Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.
   10:25: Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:
   10:26: For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.
   10:27: If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.
   10:28: But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:
   10:29: Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?
   10:30: For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
   10:31: Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
   10:32: Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:
   10:33: Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.
   11:1: Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.
   11:2: Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.
   11:3: But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
   11:4: Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.
   11:5: But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
   11:6: For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
   11:7: For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
   11:8: For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
   11:9: Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
   11:10: For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.
   11:11: Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.
   11:12: For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
   11:13: Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
   11:14: Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
   11:15: But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.
   11:16: But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
   11:17: Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
   11:18: For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
   11:19: For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.
   11:20: When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.
   11:21: For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
   11:22: What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.
   11:23: For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:
   11:24: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
   11:25: After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
   11:26: For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.
   11:27: Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
   11:28: But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.
   11:29: For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
   11:30: For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
   11:31: For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
   11:32: But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
   11:33: Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.
   11:34: And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
   12:1: Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
   12:2: Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.
   12:3: Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
   12:4: Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
   12:5: And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
   12:6: And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.
   12:7: But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
   12:8: For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
   12:9: To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
   12:10: To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
   12:11: But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
   12:12: For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.
   12:13: For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
   12:14: For the body is not one member, but many.
   12:15: If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
   12:16: And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
   12:17: If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
   12:18: But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.
   12:19: And if they were all one member, where were the body?
   12:20: But now are they many members, yet but one body.
   12:21: And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
   12:22: Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:
   12:23: And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.
   12:24: For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:
   12:25: That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.
   12:26: And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
   12:27: Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
   12:28: And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
   12:29: Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?
   12:30: Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
   12:31: But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
   13:1: Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
   13:2: And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
   13:3: And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
   13:4: Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
   13:5: Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
   13:6: Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
   13:7: Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
   13:8: Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
   13:9: For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
   13:10: But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
   13:11: When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
   13:12: For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
   13:13: And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.
   14:1: Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.
   14:2: For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.
   14:3: But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.
   14:4: He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
   14:5: I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
   14:6: Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?
   14:7: And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
   14:8: For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?
   14:9: So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.
   14:10: There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.
   14:11: Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.
   14:12: Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.
   14:13: Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.
   14:14: For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
   14:15: What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
   14:16: Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?
   14:17: For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
   14:18: I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:
   14:19: Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.
   14:20: Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.
   14:21: In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.
   14:22: Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.
   14:23: If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?
   14:24: But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:
   14:25: And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.
   14:26: How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.
   14:27: If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.
   14:28: But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
   14:29: Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.
   14:30: If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.
   14:31: For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.
   14:32: And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
   14:33: For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.
   14:34: Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.
   14:35: And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.
   14:36: What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?
   14:37: If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.
   14:38: But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
   14:39: Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
   14:40: Let all things be done decently and in order.
   15:1: Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
   15:2: By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
   15:3: For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
   15:4: And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
   15:5: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:
   15:6: After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.
   15:7: After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
   15:8: And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.
   15:9: For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
   15:10: But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
   15:11: Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.
   15:12: Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
   15:13: But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:
   15:14: And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.
   15:15: Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.
   15:16: For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:
   15:17: And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.
   15:18: Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
   15:19: If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
   15:20: But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.
   15:21: For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.
   15:22: For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
   15:23: But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.
   15:24: Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.
   15:25: For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
   15:26: The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
   15:27: For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.
   15:28: And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.
   15:29: Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?
   15:30: And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
   15:31: I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
   15:32: If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.
   15:33: Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
   15:34: Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.
   15:35: But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
   15:36: Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:
   15:37: And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:
   15:38: But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.
   15:39: All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.
   15:40: There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.
   15:41: There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.
   15:42: So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
   15:43: It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
   15:44: It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
   15:45: And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.
   15:46: Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
   15:47: The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.
   15:48: As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
   15:49: And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
   15:50: Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
   15:51: Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
   15:52: In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
   15:53: For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
   15:54: So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
   15:55: O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
   15:56: The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
   15:57: But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
   15:58: Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
   16:1: Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.
   16:2: Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.
   16:3: And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.
   16:4: And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.
   16:5: Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.
   16:6: And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.
   16:7: For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.
   16:8: But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
   16:9: For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.
   16:10: Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.
   16:11: Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.
   16:12: As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.
   16:13: Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
   16:14: Let all your things be done with charity.
   16:15: I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)
   16:16: That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.
   16:17: I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
   16:18: For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.
   16:19: The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
   16:20: All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.
   16:21: The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.
