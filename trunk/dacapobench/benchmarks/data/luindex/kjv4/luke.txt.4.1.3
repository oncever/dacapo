19:26: For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.
19:27: But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.
19:28: And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.
19:29: And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
19:30: Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.
19:31: And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.
19:32: And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.
19:33: And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?
19:34: And they said, The Lord hath need of him.
19:35: And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.
19:36: And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.
19:37: And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;
19:38: Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
19:39: And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.
19:40: And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.
19:41: And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
19:42: Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.
19:43: For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,
19:44: And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.
19:45: And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;
19:46: Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.
19:47: And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,
19:48: And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.
20:1: And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,
20:2: And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?
20:3: And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:
20:4: The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?
20:5: And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?
20:6: But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.
20:7: And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.
20:8: And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
20:9: Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.
20:10: And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.
20:11: And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.
20:12: And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.
20:13: Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.
20:14: But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
20:15: So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?
20:16: He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.
20:17: And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?
20:18: Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
20:19: And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.
20:20: And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.
20:21: And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:
20:22: Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?
20:23: But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?
20:24: Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.
20:25: And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.
20:26: And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.
20:27: Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,
20:28: Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
20:29: There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.
20:30: And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.
20:31: And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.
20:32: Last of all the woman died also.
20:33: Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.
20:34: And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:
20:35: But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
20:36: Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.
20:37: Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
20:38: For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.
20:39: Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.
20:40: And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.
20:41: And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?
20:42: And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
20:43: Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
20:44: David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?
20:45: Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,
20:46: Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;
20:47: Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.
21:1: And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.
21:2: And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.
21:3: And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:
21:4: For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.
21:5: And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,
21:6: As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
21:7: And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?
21:8: And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.
21:9: But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.
21:10: Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
21:11: And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.
21:12: But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.
21:13: And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
21:14: Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:
21:15: For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.
21:16: And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.
21:17: And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.
21:18: But there shall not an hair of your head perish.
21:19: In your patience possess ye your souls.
21:20: And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.
21:21: Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.
21:22: For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
21:23: But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.
21:24: And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
21:25: And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
21:26: Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
21:27: And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
21:28: And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.
21:29: And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;
21:30: When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.
21:31: So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.
21:32: Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.
21:33: Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
21:34: And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.
21:35: For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
21:36: Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
21:37: And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.
21:38: And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.
22:1: Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.
22:2: And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
22:3: Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
22:4: And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.
22:5: And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
22:6: And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
22:7: Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.
22:8: And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.
22:9: And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
22:10: And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.
22:11: And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
22:12: And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
22:13: And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
22:14: And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.
22:15: And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:
22:16: For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
22:17: And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:
22:18: For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.
22:19: And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.
22:20: Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
22:21: But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.
22:22: And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!
22:23: And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
22:24: And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.
22:25: And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.
22:26: But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
22:27: For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.
22:28: Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.
22:29: And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;
22:30: That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
22:31: And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:
22:32: But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.
22:33: And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.
22:34: And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.
22:35: And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.
22:36: Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.
22:37: For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.
22:38: And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.
22:39: And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.
22:40: And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
22:41: And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,
22:42: Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.
22:43: And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.
22:44: And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
22:45: And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,
22:46: And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.
22:47: And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.
22:48: But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?
22:49: When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
22:50: And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
22:51: And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.
22:52: Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?
22:53: When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
22:54: Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.
22:55: And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.
22:56: But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.
22:57: And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
22:58: And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.
22:59: And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.
22:60: And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.
22:61: And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
22:62: And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
22:63: And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.
22:64: And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?
22:65: And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
22:66: And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,
22:67: Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:
22:68: And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.
22:69: Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.
22:70: Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.
22:71: And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.
23:1: And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.
23:2: And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.
23:3: And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.
23:4: Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.
23:5: And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.
23:6: When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
23:7: And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.
23:8: And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.
23:9: Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
23:10: And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
23:11: And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
23:12: And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
23:13: And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
23:14: Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:
23:15: No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.
23:16: I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
23:17: (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
23:18: And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:
23:19: (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
23:20: Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.
23:21: But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.
23:22: And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.
23:23: And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
23:24: And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
23:25: And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
23:26: And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.
23:27: And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
23:28: But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
23:29: For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.
23:30: Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
23:31: For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
23:32: And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
23:33: And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
23:34: Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.
23:35: And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.
23:36: And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
23:37: And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.
23:38: And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
23:39: And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.
23:40: But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
23:41: And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
23:42: And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
23:43: And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
23:44: And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
23:45: And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
23:46: And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.
23:47: Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
23:48: And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
23:49: And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.
23:50: And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:
23:51: (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
23:52: This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
23:53: And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.
23:54: And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
23:55: And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.
23:56: And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
24:1: Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.
24:2: And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
24:3: And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
24:4: And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
24:5: And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
24:6: He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
24:7: Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
24:8: And they remembered his words,
24:9: And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
24:10: It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.
24:11: And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
24:12: Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
24:13: And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.
24:14: And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
24:15: And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
24:16: But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
24:17: And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?
24:18: And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?
24:19: And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:
24:20: And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.
24:21: But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
24:22: Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;
24:23: And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.
24:24: And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.
24:25: Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:
24:26: Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?
24:27: And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
24:28: And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.
24:29: But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.
24:30: And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.
24:31: And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
24:32: And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
24:33: And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
24:34: Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
24:35: And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.
24:36: And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.
24:37: But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
24:38: And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
24:39: Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
24:40: And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.
24:41: And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?
24:42: And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
24:43: And he took it, and did eat before them.
24:44: And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.
24:45: Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
24:46: And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
24:47: And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
24:48: And ye are witnesses of these things.
24:49: And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.
24:50: And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
24:51: And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.
24:52: And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
24:53: And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
