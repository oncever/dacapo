33:23: If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:
33:24: Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
33:25: His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:
33:26: He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.
33:27: He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;
33:28: He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
33:29: Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, 
33:30: To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
33:31: Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak. 
33:32: If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee. 
33:33: If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
34:1: Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
34:2: Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
34:3: For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
34:4: Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.
34:5: For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.
34:6: Should I lie against my right?  my wound is incurable without transgression.
34:7: What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?
34:8: Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
34:9: For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
34:10: Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
34:11: For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.
34:12: Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
34:13: Who hath given him a charge over the earth?  or who hath disposed the whole world?
34:14: If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
34:15: All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.
34:16: If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
34:17: Shall even he that hateth right govern?  and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
34:18: Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked?  and to princes, Ye are ungodly? 
34:19: How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor?  for they all are the work of his hands.
34:20: In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. 
34:21: For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. 
34:22: There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
34:23: For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
34:24: He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
34:25: Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
34:26: He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
34:27: Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
34:28: So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
34:29: When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?  and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?  whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:
34:30: That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
34:31: Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
34:32: That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
34:33: Should it be according to thy mind?  he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
34:34: Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
34:35: Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.
34:36: My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.
34:37: For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
35:1: Elihu spake moreover, and said,
35:2: Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?
35:3: For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee?  and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin? 
35:4: I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
35:5: Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. 
35:6: If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him?  or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him? 
35:7: If thou be righteous, what givest thou him?  or what receiveth he of thine hand?
35:8: Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.
35:9: By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
35:10: But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;
35:11: Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
35:12: There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
35:13: Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.
35:14: Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.
35:15: But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:
35:16: Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
36:1: Elihu also proceeded, and said,
36:2: Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.
36:3: I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
36:4: For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
36:5: Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.
36:6: He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
36:7: He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
36:8: And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;
36:9: Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded. 
36:10: He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
36:11: If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. 
36:12: But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. 
36:13: But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.
36:14: They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
36:15: He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.
36:16: Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.
36:17: But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.
36:18: Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
36:19: Will he esteem thy riches?  no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
36:20: Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
36:21: Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
36:22: Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?
36:23: Who hath enjoined him his way?  or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
36:24: Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.
36:25: Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
36:26: Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
36:27: For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
36:28: Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.
36:29: Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?
36:30: Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.
36:31: For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
36:32: With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt. 
36:33: The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
37:1: At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place. 
37:2: Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.
37:3: He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.
37:4: After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
37:5: God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
37:6: For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.
37:7: He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.
37:8: Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.
37:9: Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.
37:10: By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
37:11: Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:
37:12: And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.
37:13: He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.
37:14: Hearken unto this, O  stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. 
37:15: Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
37:16: Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge? 
37:17: How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind? 
37:18: Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?
37:19: Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
37:20: Shall it be told him that I speak?  if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.
37:21: And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
37:22: Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.
37:23: Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.
37:24: Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.
38:1: Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
38:2: Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
38:3: Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
38:4: Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?  declare, if thou hast understanding.
38:5: Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest?  or who hath stretched the line upon it?
38:6: Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened?  or who laid the corner stone thereof;
38:7: When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
38:8: Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?
38:9: When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,
38:10: And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,
38:11: And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
38:12: Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place; 
38:13: That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
38:14: It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment. 
38:15: And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken. 
38:16: Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?  or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
38:17: Have the gates of death been opened unto thee?  or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?
38:18: Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth?  declare if thou knowest it all.
38:19: Where is the way where light dwelleth?  and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
38:20: That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?
38:21: Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born?  or because the number of thy days is great?
38:22: Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow?  or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
38:23: Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?
38:24: By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?
38:25: Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;
38:26: To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
38:27: To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
38:28: Hath the rain a father?  or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
38:29: Out of whose womb came the ice?  and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
38:30: The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
38:31: Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
38:32: Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season?  or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?
38:33: Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven?  canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
38:34: Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?
38:35: Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are? 
38:36: Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts?  or who hath given understanding to the heart?
38:37: Who can number the clouds in wisdom?  or who can stay the bottles of heaven, 
38:38: When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together? 
38:39: Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion?  or fill the appetite of the young lions,
38:40: When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?
38:41: Who provideth for the raven his food?  when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.
39:1: Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?  or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
39:2: Canst thou number the months that they fulfil?  or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
39:3: They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.
39:4: Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.
39:5: Who hath sent out the wild ass free?  or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
39:6: Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.
39:7: He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.
39:8: The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.
39:9: Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
39:10: Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow?  or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
39:11: Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great?  or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?
39:12: Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?
39:13: Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks?  or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?
39:14: Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,
39:15: And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.
39:16: She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers: her labour is in vain without fear; 
39:17: Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
39:18: What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. 
39:19: Hast thou given the horse strength?  hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? 
39:20: Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper?  the glory of his nostrils is terrible.
39:21: He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.
39:22: He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.
39:23: The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
39:24: He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.
39:25: He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
39:26: Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?
39:27: Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?
39:28: She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
39:29: From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.
39:30: Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.
40:1: Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,
40:2: Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him?  he that reproveth God, let him answer it.
40:3: Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
40:4: Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee?  I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.
40:5: Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.
40:6: Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
40:7: Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
40:8: Wilt thou also disannul my judgment?  wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? 
40:9: Hast thou an arm like God?  or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
40:10: Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty. 
40:11: Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him. 
40:12: Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
40:13: Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.
40:14: Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.
40:15: Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.
40:16: Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.
40:17: He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
40:18: His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.
40:19: He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.
40:20: Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
40:21: He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.
40:22: The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.
40:23: Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
40:24: He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
41:1: Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook?  or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?
41:2: Canst thou put an hook into his nose?  or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
41:3: Will he make many supplications unto thee?  will he speak soft words unto thee?
41:4: Will he make a covenant with thee?  wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
41:5: Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?  or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
41:6: Shall the companions make a banquet of him?  shall they part him among the merchants? 
41:7: Canst thou fill his skin with barbed iron?  or his head with fish spears?
41:8: Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. 
41:9: Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? 
41:10: None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?
41:11: Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him?  whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.
41:12: I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
41:13: Who can discover the face of his garment?  or who can come to him with his double bridle?
41:14: Who can open the doors of his face?  his teeth are terrible round about.
41:15: His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.
41:16: One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
41:17: They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
41:18: By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
41:19: Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
41:20: Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
41:21: His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
41:22: In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him. 
41:23: The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
41:24: His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone. 
41:25: When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. 
41:26: The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
41:27: He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.
41:28: The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
41:29: Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
41:30: Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
41:31: He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
41:32: He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
41:33: Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
41:34: He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.
42:1: Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
42:2: I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.
42:3: Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge?  therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
42:4: Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
42:5: I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.
42:6: Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.
42:7: And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.
42:8: Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.
42:9: So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.
42:10: And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. 
42:11: Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.
42:12: So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. 
42:13: He had also seven sons and three daughters. 
42:14: And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.
42:15: And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of  and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
42:16: After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
42:17: So Job died, being old and full of days.
