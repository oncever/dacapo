8:2: Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.
8:3: Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him. 
8:4: They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. 
8:5: Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?
8:6: For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
8:7: For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.
8:8: Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.
8:9: For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.
8:10: Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.
8:11: Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.
8:12: I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.

9:3: They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.
9:4: They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.
9:5: What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?
9:6: For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles. 
9:7: The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.
9:8: The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God. 
9:9: They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins. 
9:10: I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to Baal-peor, and separated themselves unto that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.

9:12: Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!
9:13: Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.
9:14: Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give?  give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
9:15: All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters.
9:16: Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.
9:17: My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
10:1: Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.
10:2: Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.
10:3: For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?
10:4: They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.

10:7: As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.
10:8: The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.
10:9: O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.
10:10: It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.
10:11: And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods. 
10:12: Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.
10:13: Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men. 
10:14: Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children. 
10:15: So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.
11:1: When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.

11:8: How shall I give thee up, Ephraim?  how shall I deliver thee, Israel?  how shall I make thee as Admah?  how shall I set thee as Zeboim?  mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.
11:9: I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.
11:10: They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.
11:11: They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.
11:12: Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.
12:1: Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.

12:3: He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:
12:4: Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spake with us;
12:5: Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.

12:10: I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.
12:11: Is there iniquity in Gilead?  surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields.

14:1: O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.
14:2: Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.

14:4: I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.
14:5: I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
14:6: His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.
14:7: They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
