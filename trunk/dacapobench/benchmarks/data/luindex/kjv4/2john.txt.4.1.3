 1:9: Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.
 1:10: If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:
 1:11: For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.
