16:4: He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.

16:14: And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times. 
16:15: Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:
16:16: And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.

16:34: And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year.  And he did as the LORD commanded Moses. 
17:1: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
17:2: Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying, 
17:3: What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,
17:4: And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:
17:5: To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace offerings unto the LORD.
17:6: And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

17:9: And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.
17:10: And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.
17:11: For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.
17:12: Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.
17:13: And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.
17:14: For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.
17:15: And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.
17:16: But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.
18:1: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
18:2: Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God.
18:3: After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.
18:4: Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God. 
18:5: Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.
18:6: None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.

18:11: The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
18:12: Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman.
18:13: Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.
18:14: Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.

18:16: Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness.
18:17: Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.
18:18: Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.
18:19: Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.
18:20: Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her.
18:21: And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.
18:22: Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.
18:23: Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.

18:25: And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.
18:26: Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:
18:27: (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;) 
18:28: That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.
18:29: For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people. 
18:30: Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God. 
19:1: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
19:2: Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy.
19:3: Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.
19:4: Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.
19:5: And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will.
19:6: It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.
19:7: And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted.

19:14: Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.
19:15: Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.
19:16: Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the LORD.
19:17: Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.
19:18: Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.
19:19: Ye shall keep my statutes.  Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee. 
19:20: And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
19:21: And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering. 
19:22: And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him. 
19:23: And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.
19:24: But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal.
19:25: And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.
19:26: Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.
19:27: Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.
19:28: Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.
19:29: Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.
19:30: Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
19:31: Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.
19:32: Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.
19:33: And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.
19:34: But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
19:35: Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.
19:36: Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.

20:3: And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
20:4: And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not: 
20:5: Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.
20:6: And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. 
20:7: Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God. 
20:8: And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you.
20:9: For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.

21:19: Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded, 
21:20: Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;
21:21: No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.
21:22: He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.
21:23: Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.
21:24: And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.
22:1: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
22:2: Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD.
22:3: Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.
22:4: What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean.  And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;
22:5: Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;
22:6: The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.
22:7: And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.
22:8: That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I am the LORD.
22:9: They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.
22:10: There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.
22:11: But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.
22:12: If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.
22:13: But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.
22:14: And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing. 
22:15: And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;
22:16: Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them. 
22:17: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
22:18: Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;
22:19: Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.
22:20: But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
22:21: And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.
22:22: Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.
22:23: Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
22:24: Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land.
22:25: Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
22:26: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
22:27: When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
22:28: And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.
22:29: And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer it at your own will.
22:30: On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the LORD.
22:31: Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the LORD.
22:32: Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,
22:33: That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD.
23:1: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
23:2: Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.
23:3: Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings. 
23:4: These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.
23:5: In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's passover. 
23:6: And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread. 
23:7: In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
23:8: But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
23:9: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
23:10: Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:
23:11: And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
23:12: And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.
23:13: And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin.
23:14: And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
23:15: And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:
23:16: Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.
23:17: Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD. 
23:18: And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.
23:19: Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings. 
23:20: And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest. 
23:21: And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
23:22: And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God.
23:23: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
23:24: Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.
23:25: Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
23:26: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
23:27: Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
23:28: And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.
23:29: For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.
23:30: And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.
23:31: Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
23:32: It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.
23:33: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
23:34: Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD.
23:35: On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
23:36: Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.
23:37: These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:
23:38: Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.
23:39: Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.
23:40: And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days. 
23:41: And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year.  It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
23:42: Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths: 
23:43: That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. 
23:44: And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.
24:1: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
24:2: Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.
24:3: Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations.
24:4: He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.
24:5: And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.
24:6: And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD.
24:7: And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD
24:8: Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.
24:9: And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.
24:10: And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;
24:11: And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the LORD, and cursed.  And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)
24:12: And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.
24:13: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
24:14: Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
24:15: And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
24:16: And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the LORD, shall be put to death.
24:17: And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.
24:18: And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast. 
24:19: And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;
24:20: Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again. 
24:21: And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death. 
24:22: Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.
24:23: And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones.  And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.
25:1: And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,
25:2: Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.
25:3: Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;
25:4: But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
25:5: That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.
25:6: And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,
25:7: And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.
25:8: And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.
25:9: Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
25:10: And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.
25:11: A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.
25:12: For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
25:13: In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.
25:14: And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:
25:15: According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:
25:16: According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.
25:17: Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am the LORD your God. 
25:18: Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
25:19: And the land shall yield her fruit, and he shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety. 
25:20: And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year?  behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: 
25:21: Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.
25:22: And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.
25:23: The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.
25:24: And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
25:25: If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.
25:26: And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;
25:27: Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.
25:28: But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.
25:29: And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it. 
25:30: And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.
25:31: But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile. 
25:32: Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time. 
25:33: And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
25:34: But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
25:35: And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.
25:36: Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
25:37: Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.
25:38: I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.
25:39: And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:
25:40: But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:
25:41: And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.
25:42: For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.
25:43: Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.
25:44: Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
25:45: Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.
25:46: And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.
25:47: And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:
25:48: After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:
25:49: Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.
25:50: And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.
25:51: If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
25:52: And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption. 
25:53: And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.
25:54: And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him. 
25:55: For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. 
26:1: Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.
26:2: Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
26:3: If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
26:4: Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
26:5: And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
26:6: And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
26:7: And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
26:8: And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
26:9: For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.
26:10: And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.
26:11: And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
26:12: And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.
26:13: I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.
26:14: But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;
26:15: And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant:
26:16: I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
26:17: And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
26:18: And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
26:19: And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 
26:20: And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
26:21: And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. 
26:22: I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your highways shall be desolate. 
26:23: And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;
26:24: Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.
26:25: And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
26:26: And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
26:27: And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;
26:28: Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
26:29: And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
26:30: And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.
26:31: And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.
26:32: And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
26:33: And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.
26:34: Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.
26:35: As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
26:36: And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
26:37: And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
26:38: And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
26:39: And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
26:40: If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;
26:41: And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:
26:42: Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. 
26:43: The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
26:44: And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God. 
26:45: But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD. 
26:46: These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
27:1: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
27:2: Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.
27:3: And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
27:4: And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
27:5: And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
27:6: And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. 
27:7: And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
27:8: But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him. 
27:9: And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy. 
27:10: He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.
27:11: And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:
27:12: And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.
27:13: But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.
27:14: And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
27:15: And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
27:16: And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
27:17: If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
27:18: But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
27:19: And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
27:20: And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
27:21: But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.
27:22: And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;
27:23: Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.
27:24: In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.
27:25: And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
27:26: Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD's.
27:27: And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
27:28: Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.
27:29: None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death. 
27:30: And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD.
27:31: And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof. 
27:32: And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD. 
27:33: He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
27:34: These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
