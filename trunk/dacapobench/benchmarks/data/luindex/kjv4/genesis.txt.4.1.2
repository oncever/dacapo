27:37: And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?
27:38: And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father?  bless me, even me also, O my father.  And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
27:39: And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;
27:40: And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
27:41: And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.
27:42: And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.
27:43: Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;
27:44: And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;
27:45: Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day? 
27:46: And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?
28:1: And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 
28:2: Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.
28:3: And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;
28:4: And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.
28:5: And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
28:6: When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;
28:7: And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram;
28:8: And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
28:9: Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.
28:10: And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.
28:11: And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.
28:12: And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
28:13: And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;
28:14: And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
28:15: And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.
28:16: And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.
28:17: And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place!  this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
28:18: And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
28:19: And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.
28:20: And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
28:21: So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God: 
28:22: And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.
29:1: Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east. 
29:2: And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.
29:3: And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.
29:4: And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye?  And they said, Of Haran are we.
29:5: And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor?  And they said, We know him.
29:6: And he said unto them, Is he well?  And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
29:7: And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.
29:8: And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.
29:9: And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them.
29:10: And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
29:11: And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. 
29:12: And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.
29:13: And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house.  And he told Laban all these things. 
29:14: And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.  And he abode with him the space of a month. 
29:15: And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought?  tell me, what shall thy wages be?
29:16: And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
29:17: Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.
29:18: And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
29:19: And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
29:20: And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.
29:21: And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
29:22: And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
29:23: And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.
29:24: And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.
29:25: And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me?  did not I serve with thee for Rachel?  wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
29:26: And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
29:27: Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
29:28: And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.
29:29: And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.
29:30: And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
29:31: And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.
29:32: And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.
29:33: And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.
29:34: And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi. 
29:35: And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.
30:1: And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. 
30:2: And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
30:3: And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees that I may also have children by her.
30:4: And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.
30:5: And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.
30:6: And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.
30:7: And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.
30:8: And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.
30:9: When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.
30:10: And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.
30:11: And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.
30:12: And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.
30:13: And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.
30:14: And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah.  Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.
30:15: And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband?  and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also?  And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.
30:16: And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes.  And he lay with her that night.
30:17: And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.
30:18: And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.
30:19: And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.
30:20: And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.
30:21: And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah. 
30:22: And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.
30:23: And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach: 
30:24: And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son. 
30:25: And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.
30:26: Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.
30:27: And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.
30:28: And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
30:29: And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.
30:30: For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?
30:31: And he said, What shall I give thee?  And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock:
30:32: I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.
30:33: So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.
30:34: And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
30:35: And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
30:36: And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
30:37: And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
30:38: And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.
30:39: And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
30:40: And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle.
30:41: And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
30:42: But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
30:43: And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.
31:1: And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory.
31:2: And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before. 
31:3: And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee. 
31:4: And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
31:5: And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.
31:6: And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
31:7: And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.
31:8: If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.
31:9: Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
31:10: And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.
31:11: And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.
31:12: And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
31:13: I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.
31:14: And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
31:15: Are we not counted of him strangers?  for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.
31:16: For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.
31:17: Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
31:18: And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padan-aram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.
31:19: And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.
31:20: And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.
31:21: So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.
31:22: And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. 
31:23: And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.
31:24: And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 
31:25: Then Laban overtook Jacob.  Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead. 
31:26: And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?
31:27: Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
31:28: And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?  thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
31:29: It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
31:30: And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?
31:31: And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.
31:32: With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.  For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
31:33: And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not.  Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
31:34: Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them.  And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.
31:35: And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me.  And he searched, but found not the images.
31:36: And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass?  what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
31:37: Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff?  set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.
31:38: This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
31:39: That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.
31:40: Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.
31:41: Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
31:42: Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty.  God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.
31:43: And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?
31:44: Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
31:45: And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. 
31:46: And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.
31:47: And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed. 
31:48: And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day.  Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 
31:49: And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
31:50: If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.
31:51: And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;
31:52: This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
31:53: The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us.  And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.
31:54: Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.
31:55: And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.
32:1: And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
32:2: And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
32:3: And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
32:4: And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:
32:5: And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
32:6: And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
32:7: Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;
32:8: And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
32:9: And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:
32:10: I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
32:11: Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.
32:12: And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. 
32:13: And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;
32:14: Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 
32:15: Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals. 
32:16: And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
32:17: And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou?  and whither goest thou?  and whose are these before thee?
32:18: Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.
32:19: And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.
32:20: And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.  For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.
32:21: So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
32:22: And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
32:23: And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.
32:24: And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
32:25: And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
32:26: And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh.  And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
32:27: And he said unto him, What is thy name?  And he said, Jacob.
32:28: And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
32:29: And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.  And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?  And he blessed him there.
32:30: And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
32:31: And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
32:32: Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.
33:1: And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men.  And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.
33:2: And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 
33:3: And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
33:4: And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept. 
33:5: And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee?  And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant. 
33:6: Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
33:7: And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
33:8: And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?  And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.
33:9: And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.
33:10: And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.
33:11: Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.  And he urged him, and he took it.
33:12: And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
33:13: And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.
33:14: Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
33:15: And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me.  And he said, What needeth it?  let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
33:16: So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
33:17: And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
33:18: And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city. 
33:19: And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.
33:20: And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel. 
34:1: And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
34:2: And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.
34:3: And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.
34:4: And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
34:5: And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.
34:6: And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
34:7: And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
34:8: And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.
34:9: And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
34:10: And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
34:11: And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
34:12: Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.
34:13: And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:
34:14: And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:
34:15: But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;
34:16: Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
34:17: But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
34:18: And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.
34:19: And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.
34:20: And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying, 
34:21: These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
34:22: Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. 
34:23: Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours?  only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us. 
34:24: And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
34:25: And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.
34:26: And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.
34:27: The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.
34:28: They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,
34:29: And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.
34:30: And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
34:31: And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
35:1: And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
35:2: Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:
35:3: And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
35:4: And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
35:5: And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
35:6: So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.
35:7: And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
35:8: But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth.
35:9: And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and blessed him.
35:10: And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.
35:11: And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; 
35:12: And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
35:13: And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him. 
35:14: And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. 
35:15: And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.
35:16: And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.
35:17: And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.
35:18: And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.
35:19: And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.
35:20: And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
35:21: And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.
35:22: And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it.  Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
35:23: The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:
35:24: The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:
35:25: And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:
35:26: And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padan-aram.
35:27: And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
35:28: And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.
35:29: And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
36:1: Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.
36:2: Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
36:3: And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.
36:4: And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 
36:5: And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.
36:6: And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob. 
36:7: For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle. 
36:8: Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
36:9: And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:
36:10: These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.
36:11: And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.
36:12: And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.
36:13: And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.
36:14: And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.
36:15: These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,
36:16: Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.
36:17: And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.
36:18: And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.
36:19: These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes.
36:20: These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,
36:21: And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.
36:22: And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna.
36:23: And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
36:24: And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.
36:25: And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.
36:26: And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran. 
36:27: The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.
36:28: The children of Dishan are these: Uz, and Aran. 
36:29: These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah, 
36:30: Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.
36:31: And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.
36:32: And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
36:33: And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.
36:34: And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.
36:35: And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.
36:36: And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.
36:37: And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.
36:38: And Saul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.
36:39: And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.
36:40: And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,
36:41: Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,
36:42: Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,
36:43: Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.
37:1: And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.
37:2: These are the generations of Jacob.  Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.
37:3: Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.
37:4: And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
37:5: And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. 
37:6: And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
37:7: For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. 
37:8: And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us?  or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us?  And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. 
37:9: And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.
37:10: And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed?  Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
37:11: And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
37:12: And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
37:13: And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem?  come, and I will send thee unto them.  And he said to him, Here am I.
37:14: And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again.  So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
37:15: And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
37:16: And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.
37:17: And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan.  And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.
37:18: And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
37:19: And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
37:20: Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
37:21: And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.
37:22: And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.
37:23: And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;
37:24: And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
37:25: And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
37:26: And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?
37:27: Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh.  And his brethren were content.
37:28: Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt. 
37:29: And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
37:30: And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go? 
37:31: And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 
37:32: And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.
37:33: And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
37:34: And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
37:35: And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning.  Thus his father wept for him.
37:36: And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.
38:1: And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
38:2: And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.
38:3: And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
38:4: And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
38:5: And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.
38:6: And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.
38:7: And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.
38:8: And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
38:9: And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.
38:10: And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.
38:11: Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did.  And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
38:12: And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
38:13: And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.
38:14: And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife. 
38:15: When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.
38:16: And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? 
38:17: And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock.  And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it? 
38:18: And he said, What pledge shall I give thee?  And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand.  And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
38:19: And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
38:20: And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.
38:21: Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side?  And they said, There was no harlot in this place.
38:22: And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.
38:23: And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
38:24: And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom.  And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
38:25: When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
38:26: And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son.  And he knew her again no more.
38:27: And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.
38:28: And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first,
