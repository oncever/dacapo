7:59: And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
7:60: And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
8:1: And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
8:2: And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.
8:3: As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.
8:4: Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.
8:5: Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.
8:6: And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
8:7: For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.
8:8: And there was great joy in that city.
8:9: But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:
8:10: To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.
8:11: And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.
8:12: But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
8:13: Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.
8:14: Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
8:15: Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:
8:16: (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
8:17: Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.
8:18: And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,
8:19: Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.
8:20: But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
8:21: Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
8:22: Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.
8:23: For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.
8:24: Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.
8:25: And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
8:26: And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.
8:27: And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,
8:28: Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.
8:29: Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.
8:30: And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
8:31: And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.
8:32: The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:
8:33: In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.
8:34: And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?
8:35: Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.
8:36: And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
8:37: And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
8:38: And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
8:39: And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.
8:40: But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
9:1: And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,
9:2: And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.
9:3: And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:
9:4: And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
9:5: And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
9:6: And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.
9:7: And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.
9:8: And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.
9:9: And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.
9:10: And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.
9:11: And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,
9:12: And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.
9:13: Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:
9:14: And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.
9:15: But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:
9:16: For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.
9:17: And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.
9:18: And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.
9:19: And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.
9:20: And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.
9:21: But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?
9:22: But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.
9:23: And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:
9:24: But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.
9:25: Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.
9:26: And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.
9:27: But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
9:28: And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.
9:29: And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.
9:30: Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
9:31: Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.
9:32: And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.
9:33: And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.
9:34: And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.
9:35: And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.
9:36: Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.
9:37: And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.
9:38: And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.
9:39: Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.
9:40: But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
9:41: And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.
9:42: And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.
9:43: And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
10:1: There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,
10:2: A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.
10:3: He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.
10:4: And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.
10:5: And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:
10:6: He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.
10:7: And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;
10:8: And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.
10:9: On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:
10:10: And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,
10:11: And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:
10:12: Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
10:13: And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.
10:14: But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.
10:15: And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.
10:16: This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.
10:17: Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,
10:18: And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.
10:19: While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.
10:20: Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.
10:21: Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?
10:22: And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.
10:23: Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
10:24: And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.
10:25: And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.
10:26: But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
10:27: And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.
10:28: And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
10:29: Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?
10:30: And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
10:31: And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.
10:32: Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.
10:33: Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.
10:34: Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:
10:35: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.
10:36: The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)
10:37: That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;
10:38: How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.
10:39: And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:
10:40: Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;
10:41: Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.
10:42: And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.
10:43: To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.
10:44: While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.
10:45: And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.
10:46: For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,
10:47: Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?
10:48: And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.
11:1: And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
11:2: And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,
11:3: Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.
11:4: But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,
11:5: I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:
11:6: Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
11:7: And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.
11:8: But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.
11:9: But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.
11:10: And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.
11:11: And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.
11:12: And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:
11:13: And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;
11:14: Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.
11:15: And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.
11:16: Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
11:17: Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?
11:18: When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.
11:19: Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.
11:20: And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.
11:21: And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.
11:22: Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.
11:23: Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.
11:24: For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.
11:25: Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:
11:26: And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.
11:27: And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.
11:28: And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.
11:29: Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:
11:30: Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
12:1: Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.
12:2: And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
12:3: And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)
12:4: And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.
12:5: Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.
12:6: And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.
12:7: And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.
12:8: And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.
12:9: And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.
12:10: When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.
12:11: And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
12:12: And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.
12:13: And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.
12:14: And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.
12:15: And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.
12:16: But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.
12:17: But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.
12:18: Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.
12:19: And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.
12:20: And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.
12:21: And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.
12:22: And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.
12:23: And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.
12:24: But the word of God grew and multiplied.
12:25: And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.
13:1: Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
13:2: As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.
13:3: And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
13:4: So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
13:5: And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.
13:6: And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus:
13:7: Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.
13:8: But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.
13:9: Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,
13:10: And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
13:11: And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
13:12: Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.
13:13: Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.
13:14: But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.
13:15: And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.
13:16: Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.
13:17: The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.
13:18: And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.
13:19: And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.
13:20: And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.
13:21: And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.
13:22: And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.
13:23: Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:
13:24: When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
13:25: And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.
13:26: Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
13:27: For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.
13:28: And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.
13:29: And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.
13:30: But God raised him from the dead:
13:31: And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.
13:32: And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,
