4:13: Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,
4:14: Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:
4:15: A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.
4:16: Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.  Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.
5:1: I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. 
5:2: I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.
5:3: I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?  I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them? 
5:4: My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him. 
5:5: I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
5:6: I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
5:7: The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
5:8: I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.
5:9: What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women?  what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?
5:10: My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.
5:11: His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.
5:12: His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.
5:13: His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.
5:14: His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.
5:15: His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
5:16: His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely.  This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
6:1: Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women?  whither is thy beloved turned aside?  that we may seek him with thee.
6:2: My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
6:3: I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.
6:4: Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.
6:5: Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.
6:6: Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.
6:7: As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks. 
6:8: There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.
6:9: My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her.  The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. 
6:10: Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners? 
6:11: I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded.
6:12: Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.
6:13: Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee.  What will ye see in the Shulamite?  As it were the company of two armies.
7:1: How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter!  the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.
7:2: Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.
7:3: Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.
7:4: Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.
7:5: Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries. 
7:6: How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!
7:7: This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes. 
7:8: I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples; 
7:9: And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.
7:10: I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.
7:11: Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.
7:12: Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.
7:13: The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
8:1: O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother!  when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.
8:2: I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
8:3: His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
8:4: I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.
8:5: Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?  I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.
8:6: Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.
8:7: Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.
8:8: We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
8:9: If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.
8:10: I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.
8:11: Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.
8:12: My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
