1:10: I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:
1:11: Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:
1:12: Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:
1:13: Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
1:14: But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
1:15: For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;
1:16: Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
1:17: If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
