THIRD JOHN
 1:1: The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
 1:2: Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
 1:3: For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.
 1:4: I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
 1:5: Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;
 1:6: Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:
 1:7: Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
