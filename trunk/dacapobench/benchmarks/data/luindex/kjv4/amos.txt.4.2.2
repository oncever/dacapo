5:17: And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.
5:18: Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD!  to what end is it for you?  the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light. 
5:19: As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.
5:20: Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light?  even very dark, and no brightness in it? 
5:21: I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies. 
5:22: Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.
5:23: Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.

6:4: That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;
6:5: That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David;
6:6: That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.
6:7: Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.
6:8: The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.

6:11: For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.
6:12: Shall horses run upon the rock?  will one plow there with oxen?  for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:
6:13: Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength? 
6:14: But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of the wilderness.
7:1: Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings. 
7:2: And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise?  for he is small.
7:3: The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.
7:4: Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.

7:11: For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.
7:12: Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:
7:13: But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court.

7:15: And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.
7:16: Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac.

8:4: Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,
8:5: Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn?  and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit? 
8:6: That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat? 
8:7: The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.
8:8: Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein?  and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.
8:9: And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day:
8:10: And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.
8:11: Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:

9:2: Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:
9:3: And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:
9:4: And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.
9:5: And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.
9:6: It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.
9:7: Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel?  saith the LORD.  Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt?  and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?
9:8: Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.
9:9: For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.
9:10: All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.
9:11: In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old: 
9:12: That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.
9:13: Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt. 
9:14: And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them. 
9:15: And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God.
