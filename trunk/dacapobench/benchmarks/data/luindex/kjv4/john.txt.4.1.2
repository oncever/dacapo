10:3: To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.
10:4: And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
10:5: And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
10:6: This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.
10:7: Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
10:8: All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
10:9: I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
10:10: The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.
10:11: I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
10:12: But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.
10:13: The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
10:14: I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.
10:15: As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
10:16: And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.
10:17: Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.
10:18: No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.
10:19: There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.
10:20: And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?
10:21: Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
10:22: And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.
10:23: And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.
10:24: Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.
10:25: Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.
10:26: But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.
10:27: My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
10:28: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
10:29: My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.
10:30: I and my Father are one.
10:31: Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
10:32: Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
10:33: The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
10:34: Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?
10:35: If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
10:36: Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?
10:37: If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
10:38: But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.
10:39: Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,
10:40: And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.
10:41: And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.
10:42: And many believed on him there.
11:1: Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
11:2: (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
11:3: Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
11:4: When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.
11:5: Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
11:6: When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.
11:7: Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.
11:8: His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?
11:9: Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
11:10: But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.
11:11: These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
11:12: Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
11:13: Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
11:14: Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
11:15: And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.
11:16: Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
11:17: Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.
11:18: Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
11:19: And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
11:20: Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.
11:21: Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
11:22: But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.
11:23: Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
11:24: Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
11:25: Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
11:26: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?
11:27: She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.
11:28: And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.
11:29: As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.
11:30: Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.
11:31: The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.
11:32: Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
11:33: When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
11:34: And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.
11:35: Jesus wept.
11:36: Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!
11:37: And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?
11:38: Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
11:39: Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.
11:40: Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
11:41: Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.
11:42: And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
11:43: And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
11:44: And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.
11:45: Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.
11:46: But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.
11:47: Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.
11:48: If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.
11:49: And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,
11:50: Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
11:51: And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;
11:52: And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
11:53: Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.
11:54: Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
11:55: And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.
11:56: Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?
11:57: Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.
12:1: Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.
12:2: There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.
12:3: Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
12:4: Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,
12:5: Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?
12:6: This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.
12:7: Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.
12:8: For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.
12:9: Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
12:10: But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;
12:11: Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
12:12: On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
12:13: Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.
12:14: And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
12:15: Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.
12:16: These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.
12:17: The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.
12:18: For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.
12:19: The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.
12:20: And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:
12:21: The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
12:22: Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
12:23: And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
12:24: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
12:25: He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
12:26: If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.
12:27: Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.
12:28: Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
12:29: The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.
12:30: Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.
12:31: Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
12:32: And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.
12:33: This he said, signifying what death he should die.
12:34: The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
12:35: Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
12:36: While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.
12:37: But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:
12:38: That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
12:39: Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,
12:40: He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
12:41: These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.
12:42: Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
12:43: For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
12:44: Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
12:45: And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.
12:46: I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.
12:47: And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
12:48: He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.
12:49: For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
12:50: And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.
13:1: Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.
13:2: And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;
13:3: Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;
13:4: He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.
13:5: After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.
13:6: Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
13:7: Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
13:8: Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
13:9: Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
13:10: Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.
13:11: For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.
13:12: So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?
13:13: Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.
13:14: If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.
13:15: For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.
13:16: Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.
13:17: If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
13:18: I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.
13:19: Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.
13:20: Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
13:21: When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
13:22: Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.
13:23: Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
13:24: Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.
13:25: He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?
13:26: Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
13:27: And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.
13:28: Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.
13:29: For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
13:30: He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.
13:31: Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
13:32: If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.
13:33: Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.
13:34: A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
13:35: By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
13:36: Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.
13:37: Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.
13:38: Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.
14:1: Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.
14:2: In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
14:3: And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
14:4: And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.
14:5: Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?
14:6: Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
14:7: If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.
14:8: Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
14:9: Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?
14:10: Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.
14:11: Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.
14:12: Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.
14:13: And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
14:14: If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
14:15: If ye love me, keep my commandments.
14:16: And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
14:17: Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
14:18: I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
14:19: Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.
14:20: At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
14:21: He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
14:22: Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?
14:23: Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.
14:24: He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.
14:25: These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.
14:26: But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
14:27: Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
14:28: Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.
14:29: And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.
14:30: Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.
14:31: But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
15:1: I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
15:2: Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.
15:3: Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
15:4: Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.
