11:17: That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.
11:18: And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
11:19: And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
11:20: And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.
11:21: And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country. 
11:22: Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country?  And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.
11:23: And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah: 
11:24: And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus. 
11:25: And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
11:26: And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.
11:27: And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.
11:28: And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.
11:29: And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:
11:30: And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:
11:31: And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:
11:32: (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)
11:33: Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.
11:34: Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:
11:35: But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.
11:36: And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.
11:37: And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.
11:38: And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.
11:39: And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
11:40: Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam.  And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
11:41: And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
11:42: And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
11:43: And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
12:1: And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.
12:2: And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)
12:3: That they sent and called him.  And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,
12:4: Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
12:5: And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me.  And the people departed.
12:6: And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people? 
12:7: And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.
12:8: But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him: 
12:9: And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter? 
12:10: And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
12:11: And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
12:12: So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.
12:13: And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;
12:14: And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
12:15: Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
12:16: So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?  neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David.  So Israel departed unto their tents.
12:17: But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
12:18: Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.  Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
12:19: So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
12:20: And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
12:21: And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
12:22: But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
12:23: Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
12:24: Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me.  They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.
12:25: Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.
12:26: And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:
12:27: If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.
12:28: Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
12:29: And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan. 
12:30: And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.
12:31: And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi. 
12:32: And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar.  So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made. 
12:33: So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.
13:1: And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.
13:2: And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.
13:3: And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.
13:4: And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him.  And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.
13:5: The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
13:6: And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.  And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.
13:7: And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.
13:8: And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:
13:9: For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.
13:10: So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.
13:11: Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.
13:12: And their father said unto them, What way went he?  For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.
13:13: And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass.  So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,
13:14: And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah?  And he said, I am.
13:15: Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
13:16: And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:
13:17: For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.
13:18: He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water.  But he lied unto him. 
13:19: So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.
13:20: And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back: 
13:21: And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee, 
13:22: But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the LORD did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.
13:23: And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.
13:24: And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase.
13:25: And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
13:26: And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.
13:27: And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass.  And they saddled him.
13:28: And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass.
13:29: And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.
13:30: And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!
13:31: And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:
13:32: For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
13:33: After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.
13:34: And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the ear
14:1: At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
14:2: And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.
14:3: And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.
14:4: And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah.  But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
14:5: And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman.
14:6: And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another?  for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings. 
14:7: Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,
14:8: And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes; 
14:9: But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back: 
14:10: Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.
14:11: Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it.
14:12: Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
14:13: And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
14:14: Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what?  even now.
14:15: For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.
14:16: And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.
14:17: And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;
14:18: And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.
14:19: And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
14:20: And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with this fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
14:21: And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah.  Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.  And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
14:22: And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.
14:23: For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.
14:24: And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
14:25: And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:
14:26: And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
14:27: And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house.
14:28: And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.
14:29: Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
14:30: And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
14:31: And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David.  And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.  And Abijam his son reigned in his stead. 
15:1: Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.
15:2: Three years reigned he in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
15:3: And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.
15:4: Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:
15:5: Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
15:6: And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
15:7: Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
15:8: And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
15:9: And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.
15:10: And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
15:11: And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father.
15:12: And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
15:13: And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.
15:14: But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.
15:15: And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.
15:16: And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
15:17: And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
15:18: Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
15:19: There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
15:20: So Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. 
15:21: And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
15:22: Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. 
15:23: The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. 
15:24: And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
15:25: And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.
15:26: And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
15:27: And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.
15:28: Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.
15:29: And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:
15:30: Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.
15:31: Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
15:32: And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
15:33: In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.
15:34: And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
16:1: Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,
16:2: Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;
16:3: Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
16:4: Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.
16:5: Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
16:6: So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
16:7: And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.
16:8: In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years. 
16:9: And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.
16:10: And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
16:11: And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.
16:12: Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
16:13: For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities. 
16:14: Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
16:15: In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah.  And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. 
16:16: And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp. 
16:17: And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
16:18: And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died,
16:19: For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
16:20: Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
16:21: Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
16:22: But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
16:23: In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.
16:24: And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.
16:25: But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.
16:26: For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
16:27: Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
16:28: So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
16:29: And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.
16:30: And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him.
16:31: And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.
16:32: And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
16:33: And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.
16:34: In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.
17:1: And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word. 
17:2: And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,
17:3: Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. 
17:4: And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. 
17:5: So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.
17:6: And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
17:7: And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
17:8: And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,
17:9: Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.
17:10: So he arose and went to Zarephath.  And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
17:11: And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.
17:12: And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
17:13: And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.
17:14: For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.
17:15: And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.
17:16: And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.
17:17: And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
17:18: And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God?  art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?
17:19: And he said unto her, Give me thy son.  And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
17:20: And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
17:21: And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.
17:22: And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
17:23: And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.
17:24: And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth. 
18:1: And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth. 
18:2: And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab.  And there was a sore famine in Samaria. 
18:3: And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.  (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:
18:4: For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
18:5: And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
18:6: So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
18:7: And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?
18:8: And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
18:9: And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?
18:10: As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.
18:11: And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
18:12: And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.
18:13: Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
18:14: And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.
18:15: And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.
18:16: So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
18:17: And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?
18:18: And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.
18:19: Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.
18:20: So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.
18:21: And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions?  if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him.  And the people answered him not a word.
18:22: Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men. 
18:23: Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:
18:24: And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God.  And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken. 
18:25: And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under. 
18:26: And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us.  But there was no voice, nor any that answered.  And they leaped upon the altar which was made.
18:27: And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.
18:28: And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.
18:29: And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
18:30: And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me.  And all the people came near unto him.  And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.
18:31: And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name: 
18:32: And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
18:33: And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood. 
18:34: And he said, Do it the second time.  And they did it the second time.  And he said, Do it the third time.  And they did it the third time. 
18:35: And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
18:36: And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.
18:37: Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.
18:38: Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
18:39: And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.
18:40: And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.  And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
18:41: And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.
18:42: So Ahab went up to eat and to drink.  And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,
18:43: And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea.  And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing.  And he said, Go again seven times.
18:44: And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand.  And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.
18:45: And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain.  And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.
18:46: And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
19:1: And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
19:2: Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.
19:3: And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.
19:4: But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.
19:5: And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.
19:6: And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head.  And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.
19:7: And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee. 
19:8: And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.
19:9: And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah? 
19:10: And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. 
19:11: And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.  And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:
19:12: And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
19:13: And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave.  And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?
19:14: And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
19:15: And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:
19:16: And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.
19:17: And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.
19:18: Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.
19:19: So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.
19:20: And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee.  And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?
19:21: And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat.  Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.
20:1: And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.
20:2: And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad,
20:3: Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.
20:4: And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.
20:5: And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;
20:6: Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.
20:7: Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.
20:8: And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent. 
20:9: Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do.  And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.
20:10: And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me. 
20:11: And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off. 
20:12: And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array.  And they set themselves in array against the city.
20:13: And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude?  behold, I will deliver it in to thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.
20:14: And Ahab said, By whom?  And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces.  Then he said, Who shall order the battle?  And he answered, Thou.
20:15: Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.
20:16: And they went out at noon.  But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.
20:17: And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.
20:18: And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.
20:19: So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.
20:20: And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.
20:21: And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
20:22: And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thy self, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
20:23: And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
20:24: And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:
20:25: And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.  And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.
20:26: And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
20:27: And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.
20:28: And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.
20:29: And they pitched one over against the other seven days.  And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.
20:30: But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left.  And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
20:31: And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life. 
20:32: So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live.  And he said, Is he yet alive?  he is my brother.
20:33: Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad.  Then he said, Go ye, bring him.  Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot. 
20:34: And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.  Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant.  So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away. 
20:35: And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee.  And the man refused to smite him.
20:36: Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee.  And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.
20:37: Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee.  And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.
20:38: So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.
20:39: And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
20:40: And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone.  And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.
20:41: And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.
20:42: And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.
20:43: And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.
21:1: And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
21:2: And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.
21:3: And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.
21:4: And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.  And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
21:5: But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?
21:6: And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.
21:7: And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel?  arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
21:8: So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.
21:9: And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:
21:10: And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king.  And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die. 
21:11: And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.
21:12: They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. 
21:13: And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king.  Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died. 
21:14: Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
21:15: And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
21:16: And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
21:17: And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
21:18: Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.
21:19: And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?  And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
21:20: And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?  And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.
21:21: Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
21:22: And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.
21:23: And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
21:24: Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.
21:25: But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.
21:26: And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
21:27: And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
21:28: And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
21:29: Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me?  because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.
22:1: And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
22:2: And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
22:3: And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria? 
22:4: And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead?  And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
22:5: And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day. 
22:6: Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?  And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king. 
22:7: And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?
22:8: And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.  And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
22:9: Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.
22:10: And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
22:11: And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.
22:12: And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king's hand.
22:13: And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.
22:14: And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.
22:15: So he came to the king.  And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?  And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
22:16: And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?
22:17: And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.
22:18: And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?
22:19: And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
22:20: And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?  And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.
22:21: And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.
22:22: And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?  And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.  And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.
22:23: Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.
22:24: But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?
22:25: And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. 
22:26: And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
22:27: And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace. 
22:28: And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me.  And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you. 
22:29: So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
22:30: And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.  And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
22:31: But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
22:32: And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel.  And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
22:33: And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
22:34: And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
22:35: And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.
22:36: And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.
22:37: So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
22:38: And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.
22:39: Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
22:40: So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
22:41: And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
22:42: Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
22:43: And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.
22:44: And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
22:45: Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
22:46: And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.
22:47: There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.
22:48: Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber. 
22:49: Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships.  But Jehoshaphat would not.
22:50: And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. 
22:51: Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel. 
22:52: And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:
