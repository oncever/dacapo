116:9: I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
116:10: I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:
116:11: I said in my haste, All men are liars.
116:12: What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?
116:13: I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.
116:14: I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people. 
116:15: Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.

116:17: I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD. 
116:18: I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people,
116:19: In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.  Praise ye the LORD.
117:1: O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.
117:2: For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever.  Praise ye the LORD.

118:2: Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.

118:6: The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?
118:7: The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.
118:8: It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.
118:9: It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.
118:10: All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.
118:11: They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
118:12: They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
118:13: Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.
118:14: The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.

118:16: The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 
118:17: I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD. 
118:18: The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.
118:19: Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD:
118:20: This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.
118:21: I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.
118:22: The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.
118:23: This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.
118:24: This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.

120:6: My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.
120:7: I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.
121:1: I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. 
121:2: My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.
121:3: He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. 
121:4: Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. 
121:5: The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.
121:6: The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
121:7: The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.
121:8: The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.
122:1: I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.
122:2: Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
122:3: Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:
122:4: Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.
122:5: For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
122:6: Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
122:7: Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.
122:8: For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.
122:9: Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
123:1: Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
123:2: Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.
123:3: Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
123:4: Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.
124:1: If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;
124:2: If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us: 
124:3: Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: 
124:4: Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:
124:5: Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
124:6: Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.
124:7: Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
124:8: Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
125:1: They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.
125:2: As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.
125:3: For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.
125:4: Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.
125:5: As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.
126:1: When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
126:2: Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.
126:3: The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.
126:4: Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.
126:5: They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
126:6: He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
127:1: Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. 
127:2: It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
127:3: Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 
127:4: As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. 
127:5: Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
128:1: Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.
128:2: For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
128:3: Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
128:4: Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.
128:5: The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
128:6: Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel.
129:1: Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:
129:2: Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.
129:3: The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.
129:4: The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
129:5: Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
129:6: Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:
129:7: Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
129:8: Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
130:1: Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.
130:2: Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. 
130:3: If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
130:4: But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. 
130:5: I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. 
130:6: My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.
130:7: Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.
130:8: And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
131:1: LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.
131:2: Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.
131:3: Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
132:1: LORD, remember David, and all his afflictions:
132:2: How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;
132:3: Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;
132:4: I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,
132:5: Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.
132:6: Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.
132:7: We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.
132:8: Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.
132:9: Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.
132:10: For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.
132:11: The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
132:12: If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore. 
132:13: For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.
132:14: This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it. 
132:15: I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread. 
132:16: I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
132:17: There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.
132:18: His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
133:1: Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
133:2: It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;
133:3: As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.
134:1: Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD.
134:2: Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.
134:3: The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.
135:1: Praise ye the LORD.  Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD.
135:2: Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God,
135:3: Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.
135:4: For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.
135:5: For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. 
135:6: Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.
135:7: He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries. 
135:8: Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. 
135:9: Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
135:10: Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;
135:11: Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:
135:12: And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.
135:13: Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.
135:14: For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.
135:15: The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
135:16: They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;
135:17: They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.
135:18: They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.
135:19: Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:
135:20: Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.
135:21: Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem.  Praise ye the LORD.
136:1: O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
136:2: O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.
136:3: O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
136:4: To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever.
136:5: To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.
136:6: To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
136:7: To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever:
136:8: The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
136:9: The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
136:10: To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endureth for ever:
136:11: And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever:
136:12: With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.
136:13: To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy endureth for ever:
136:14: And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever:
136:15: But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy endureth for ever.
136:16: To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.
136:17: To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:
136:18: And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:
136:19: Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:
136:20: And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:
136:21: And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever:
136:22: Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.
136:23: Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for ever:
136:24: And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.
136:25: Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.
136:26: O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.
137:1: By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
137:2: We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. 
137:3: For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
137:4: How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land? 
137:5: If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. 
137:6: If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.
137:7: Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.
137:8: O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.
137:9: Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
138:1: I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.
138:2: I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
138:3: In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.
138:4: All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.
138:5: Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD.
138:6: Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.
138:7: Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.
138:8: The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.
139:1: O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me.
139:2: Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.
139:3: Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.
139:4: For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.
139:5: Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.
139:6: Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. 
139:7: Whither shall I go from thy spirit?  or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
139:8: If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. 
139:9: If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; 
139:10: Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
139:11: If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.
139:12: Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
139:13: For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
139:14: I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.
139:15: My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
139:16: Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
139:17: How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God!  how great is the sum of them!
139:18: If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.
139:19: Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.
139:20: For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.
139:21: Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee?  and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
139:22: I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
139:23: Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:
139:24: And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
140:1: Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;
140:2: Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war.
140:3: They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips.  Selah.
140:4: Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings. 
140:5: The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me.  Selah.
140:6: I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD. 
140:7: O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle. 
140:8: Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves.  Selah.
140:9: As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
140:10: Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
140:11: Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
140:12: I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.
140:13: Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
141:1: LORD, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.
141:2: Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
141:3: Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
141:4: Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.
141:5: Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.
141:6: When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
141:7: Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.
141:8: But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.
141:9: Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.
141:10: Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
142:1: I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.
142:2: I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. 
142:3: When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path.  In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
142:4: I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. 
142:5: I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living. 
142:6: Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
142:7: Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
143:1: Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.
143:2: And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
143:3: For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead. 
143:4: Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.
143:5: I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands. 
143:6: I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land.  Selah. 
143:7: Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
143:8: Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.
143:9: Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.
143:10: Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.
143:11: Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.
143:12: And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.
144:1: Blessed be the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:
144:2: My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.
144:3: LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him!  or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!
144:4: Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.
144:5: Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
144:6: Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.
144:7: Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;
144:8: Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
144:9: I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
144:10: It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.
144:11: Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:
144:12: That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:
144:13: That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets: 
144:14: That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.
144:15: Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD. 
145:1: I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
145:2: Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
145:3: Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.
145:4: One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.
145:5: I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works.
145:6: And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness.
145:7: They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.
145:8: The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy.
145:9: The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.
145:10: All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee.
145:11: They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;
145:12: To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.
145:13: Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
145:14: The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.
145:15: The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.
145:16: Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
145:17: The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.
145:18: The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.
145:19: He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.
145:20: The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy. 
145:21: My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
146:1: Praise ye the LORD.  Praise the LORD, O my soul. 
146:2: While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
146:3: Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
146:4: His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
146:5: Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God:
146:6: Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:
146:7: Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry.  The LORD looseth the prisoners:
