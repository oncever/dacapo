1:13: Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?
1:14: And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?
1:15: They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.

1:17: Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?
