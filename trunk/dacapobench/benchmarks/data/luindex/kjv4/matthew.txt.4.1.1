9:33: And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.
9:34: But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.
9:35: And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
9:36: But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
9:37: Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;
9:38: Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.
10:1: And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.
10:2: Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
10:3: Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;
10:4: Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
10:5: These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:
10:6: But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
10:7: And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
10:8: Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.
10:9: Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,
10:10: Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.
10:11: And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.
10:12: And when ye come into an house, salute it.
10:13: And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.
10:14: And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.
10:15: Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
10:16: Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
10:17: But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;
10:18: And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.
10:19: But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.
10:20: For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.
10:21: And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.
10:22: And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.
10:23: But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.
10:24: The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.
10:25: It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?
10:26: Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
10:27: What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.
10:28: And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
10:29: Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
10:30: But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
10:31: Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.
10:32: Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.
10:33: But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.
10:34: Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
10:35: For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.
10:36: And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.
10:37: He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
10:38: And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.
10:39: He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.
10:40: He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
10:41: He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.
10:42: And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
11:1: And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.
11:2: Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
11:3: And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?
11:4: Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:
11:5: The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
11:6: And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.
11:7: And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
11:8: But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.
11:9: But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.
11:10: For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
11:11: Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
11:12: And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.
11:13: For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
11:14: And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.
11:15: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
11:16: But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,
11:17: And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.
11:18: For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.
11:19: The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.
11:20: Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:
11:21: Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
11:22: But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.
11:23: And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
11:24: But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.
11:25: At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.
11:26: Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.
11:27: All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.
11:28: Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
11:29: Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
11:30: For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
12:1: At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.
12:2: But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.
12:3: But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;
12:4: How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?
12:5: Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?
12:6: But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.
12:7: But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.
12:8: For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.
12:9: And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:
12:10: And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.
12:11: And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?
12:12: How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.
12:13: Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.
12:14: Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.
12:15: But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;
12:16: And charged them that they should not make him known:
12:17: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
12:18: Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.
12:19: He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.
12:20: A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.
12:21: And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
12:22: Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.
12:23: And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?
12:24: But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.
12:25: And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:
12:26: And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?
12:27: And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.
12:28: But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.
12:29: Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.
12:30: He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.
12:31: Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.
12:32: And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.
12:33: Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.
12:34: O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
12:35: A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.
12:36: But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
12:37: For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
12:38: Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.
12:39: But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:
12:40: For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
12:41: The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.
12:42: The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
12:43: When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.
12:44: Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.
12:45: Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.
12:46: While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.
12:47: Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.
12:48: But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
12:49: And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
12:50: For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
13:1: The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
13:2: And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
13:3: And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;
13:4: And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:
13:5: Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:
13:6: And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
13:7: And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:
13:8: But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.
13:9: Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
13:10: And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
13:11: He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
13:12: For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.
13:13: Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
13:14: And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:
13:15: For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
13:16: But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.
13:17: For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.
13:18: Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
13:19: When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.
13:20: But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;
13:21: Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.
13:22: He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
13:23: But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
13:24: Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:
13:25: But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
13:26: But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
13:27: So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?
13:28: He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?
13:29: But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.
13:30: Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
13:31: Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:
13:32: Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.
13:33: Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
13:34: All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:
13:35: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
13:36: Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
13:37: He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
13:38: The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;
13:39: The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
13:40: As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
13:41: The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;
13:42: And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
13:43: Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
13:44: Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
13:45: Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:
13:46: Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
13:47: Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
13:48: Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.
13:49: So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,
13:50: And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
13:51: Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.
13:52: Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.
13:53: And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.
13:54: And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
13:55: Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
13:56: And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?
13:57: And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.
13:58: And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
14:1: At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
14:2: And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.
14:3: For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.
14:4: For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
14:5: And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
14:6: But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.
14:7: Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.
14:8: And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.
14:9: And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.
14:10: And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
14:11: And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.
14:12: And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
14:13: When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.
14:14: And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.
14:15: And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.
14:16: But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.
14:17: And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.
14:18: He said, Bring them hither to me.
14:19: And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
14:20: And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
14:21: And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.
14:22: And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
14:23: And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.
14:24: But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.
14:25: And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.
14:26: And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.
14:27: But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
14:28: And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.
14:29: And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.
14:30: But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.
14:31: And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
14:32: And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
14:33: Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.
14:34: And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.
14:35: And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;
14:36: And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
15:1: Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,
15:2: Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
15:3: But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?
15:4: For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
15:5: But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;
15:6: And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.
15:7: Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
15:8: This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
15:9: But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
15:10: And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:
15:11: Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
15:12: Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?
15:13: But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.
15:14: Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.
15:15: Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.
15:16: And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?
15:17: Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
15:18: But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.
15:19: For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:
15:20: These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.
15:21: Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
15:22: And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
15:23: But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
15:24: But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
15:25: Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
15:26: But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.
15:27: And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.
15:28: Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.
15:29: And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
15:30: And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:
15:31: Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
15:32: Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
15:33: And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
15:34: And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
15:35: And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
15:36: And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
15:37: And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.
15:38: And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.
15:39: And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
16:1: The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.
16:2: He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.
16:3: And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?
16:4: A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.
16:5: And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
16:6: Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
16:7: And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.
