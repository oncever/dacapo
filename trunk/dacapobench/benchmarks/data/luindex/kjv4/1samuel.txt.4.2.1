9:24: And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul.  And Samuel said, Behold that which is left!  set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people.  So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
9:25: And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.
9:26: And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away.  And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
9:27: And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.
10:1: Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?
10:2: When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
10:3: Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
10:4: And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.
10:5: After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:
10:6: And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man. 
10:7: And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.
10:8: And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do. 
10:9: And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day. 
10:10: And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.
10:11: And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish?  Is Saul also among the prophets?
10:12: And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father?  Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
10:13: And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
10:14: And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye?  And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.
10:15: And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.
10:16: And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found.  But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.
10:17: And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;
10:18: And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:
10:19: And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us.  Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.
10:20: And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
10:21: When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.
10:22: Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither.  And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.
10:23: And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
10:24: And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?  And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.
10:25: Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD.  And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
10:26: And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.
10:27: But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us?  And they despised him, and brought him no presents.  But he held his peace.
11:1: Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee. 
11:2: And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
11:3: And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee. 
11:4: Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept. 
11:5: And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep?  And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.
11:6: And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.
11:7: And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen.  And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.
11:8: And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
11:9: And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help.  And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
11:10: Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.
11:11: And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.
11:12: And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us?  bring the men, that we may put them to death.
11:13: And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.
11:14: Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
11:15: And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
12:1: And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.
12:2: And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.
12:3: Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken?  or whose ass have I taken?  or whom have I defrauded?  whom have I oppressed?  or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith?  and I will restore it you.
12:4: And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.
12:5: And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand.  And they answered, He is witness.
12:6: And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
12:7: Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.
12:8: When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place. 
12:9: And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
12:10: And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee. 
12:11: And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe. 
12:12: And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.
12:13: Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired!  and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.
12:14: If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:
12:15: But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.
12:16: Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.
12:17: Is it not wheat harvest to day?  I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.
12:18: So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
12:19: And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.
12:20: And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;
12:21: And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.
12:22: For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.
12:23: Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:
12:24: Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.
12:25: But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.
13:1: Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
13:2: Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
13:3: And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it.  And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
13:4: And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines.  And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
13:5: And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.
13:6: When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
13:7: And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead.  As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. 
13:8: And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
13:9: And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings.  And he offered the burnt offering. 
13:10: And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. 
13:11: And Samuel said, What hast thou done?  And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;
13:12: Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.
13:13: And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.
13:14: But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.
13:15: And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin.  And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.
13:16: And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
13:17: And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:
13:18: And another company turned the way to Beth-horon: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
13:19: Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:
13:20: But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.
13:21: Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
13:22: So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
13:23: And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
14:1: Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side.  But he told not his father.
14:2: And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;
14:3: And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I-chabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod.  And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
14:4: And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
14:5: The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.
14:6: And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few. 
14:7: And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.
14:8: Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them. 
14:9: If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. 
14:10: But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.
14:11: And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
14:12: And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing.  And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.
14:13: And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.
14:14: And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.
14:15: And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.
14:16: And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.
14:17: Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us.  And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.
14:18: And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God.  For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
14:19: And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.
14:20: And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.
14:21: Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
14:22: Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
14:23: So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Beth-aven.
14:24: And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies.  So none of the people tasted any food.
14:25: And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.
14:26: And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.
14:27: But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
14:28: Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day.  And the people were faint.
14:29: Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey. 
14:30: How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found?  for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
14:31: And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint. 
14:32: And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood. 
14:33: Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood.  And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.
14:34: And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood.  And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.
14:35: And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.
14:36: And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.  And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee.  Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.
14:37: And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines?  wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?  But he answered him not that day.
14:38: And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.
14:39: For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.  But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.
14:40: Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.  And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.
14:41: Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot.  And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.
14:42: And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.  And Jonathan was taken.
14:43: Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done.  And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.
14:44: And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.
14:45: And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel?  God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day.  So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
14:46: Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
14:47: So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.
14:48: And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.
14:49: Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
14:50: And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
14:51: And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
14:52: And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him. 
15:1: Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD. 
15:2: Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. 
15:3: Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
15:4: And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
15:5: And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
15:6: And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.  So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
15:7: And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.
15:8: And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
15:9: But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
15:10: Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,
15:11: It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments.  And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.
15:12: And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
15:13: And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.
15:14: And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
15:15: And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
15:16: Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night.  And he said unto him, Say on.
15:17: And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?
15:18: And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
15:19: Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?
15:20: And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
15:21: But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.
15:22: And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD?  Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. 
15:23: For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.  Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.
15:24: And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice. 
15:25: Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD. 
15:26: And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.
15:27: And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
15:28: And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.
15:29: And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.
15:30: Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.
15:31: So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.
15:32: Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.  And Agag came unto him delicately.  And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
15:33: And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women.  And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.
15:34: Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
15:35: And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
16:1: And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?  fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.
16:2: And Samuel said, How can I go?  if Saul hear it, he Will kill me.  And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.
16:3: And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.
16:4: And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem.  And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?
16:5: And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.  And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
16:6: And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.
16:7: But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.
16:8: Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.  And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
16:9: Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by.  And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. 
16:10: Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel.  And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.
16:11: And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children?  And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep.  And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither. 
16:12: And he sent, and brought him in.  Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to.  And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he. 
16:13: Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward.  So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
16:14: But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.
16:15: And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
16:16: Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
16:17: And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
16:18: Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.
16:19: Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep.
16:20: And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.
16:21: And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.
16:22: And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.
16:23: And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
17:1: Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
17:2: And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
17:3: And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
17:4: And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
17:5: And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.
17:6: And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.
17:7: And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.
17:8: And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array?  am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul?  choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me. 
17:9: If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.
17:10: And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together. 
17:11: When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid. 
17:12: Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.
17:13: And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
17:14: And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
17:15: But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
17:16: And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days. 
17:17: And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;
17:18: And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge. 
17:19: Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. 
17:20: And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.
17:21: For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.
17:22: And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.
17:23: And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.
17:24: And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.
17:25: And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up?  surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.
17:26: And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel?  for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
17:27: And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.
17:28: And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither?  and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness?  I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.
17:29: And David said, What have I now done?  Is there not a cause?
17:30: And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.
17:31: And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.
17:32: And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
17:33: And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
17:34: And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:
17:35: And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
17:36: Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.
17:37: David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.  And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.
17:38: And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.
17:39: And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it.  And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them.  And David put them off him. 
17:40: And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.
17:41: And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him. 
17:42: And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance. 
17:43: And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves?  And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
17:44: And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.
17:45: Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
17:46: This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
17:47: And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.
17:48: And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.
17:49: And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.
17:50: So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.
17:51: Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith.  And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.
17:52: And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron.  And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.
17:53: And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.
17:54: And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.
17:55: And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth?  And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.
17:56: And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.
17:57: And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
17:58: And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man?  And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.
18:1: And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
18:2: And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.
18:3: Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. 
18:4: And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
18:5: And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants. 
18:6: And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick. 
18:7: And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
18:8: And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?
18:9: And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
18:10: And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.
18:11: And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it.  And David avoided out of his presence twice.
18:12: And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.
18:13: Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
18:14: And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.
18:15: Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.
18:16: But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.
18:17: And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles.  For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
18:18: And David said unto Saul, Who am I?  and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?
18:19: But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
18:20: And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
18:21: And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.  Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain.
18:22: And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.
18:23: And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David.  And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
18:24: And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.
18:25: And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies.  But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
18:26: And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired. 
18:27: Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law.  And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.
18:28: And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him. 
18:29: And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.
18:30: Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.
19:1: And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.
19:2: But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself: 
19:3: And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.
19:4: And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to theeward very good: 
19:5: For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause? 
19:6: And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.
19:7: And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things.  And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.
19:8: And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.
19:9: And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.
19:10: And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.
19:11: Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.
19:12: So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.
19:13: And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.
19:14: And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
19:15: And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.
19:16: And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.
19:17: And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped?  And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?
19:18: So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him.  And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
19:19: And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
19:20: And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
19:21: And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise.  And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.
19:22: Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David?  And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.
19:23: And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
19:24: And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night.  Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?
20:1: And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done?  what is mine iniquity?  and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?
20:2: And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me?  it is not so. 
20:3: And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death. 
20:4: Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.
20:5: And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.
20:6: If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
20:7: If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.
20:8: Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?
20:9: And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?
20:10: Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me?  or what if thy father answer thee roughly?
20:11: And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field.  And they went out both of them into the field.
20:12: And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;
20:13: The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.
20:14: And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:
20:15: But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.
20:16: So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.
20:17: And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
20:18: Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.
20:19: And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
20:20: And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.
20:21: And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows.  If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.
20:22: But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.
20:23: And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever. 
20:24: So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.
20:25: And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty. 
20:26: Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean. 
20:27: And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?
20:28: And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:
20:29: And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren.  Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.
20:30: Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?
20:31: For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom.  Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.
20:32: And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain?  what hath he done?
20:33: And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.
20:34: So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
20:35: And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
20:36: And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot.  And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
20:37: And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?
20:38: And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not.  And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
20:39: But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
20:40: And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.
20:41: And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
20:42: And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.  And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.
21:1: Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?
21:2: And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.
21:3: Now therefore what is under thine hand?  give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present. 
21:4: And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
21:5: And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.
21:6: So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
21:7: Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.
21:8: And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword?  for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.
21:9: And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here.  And David said, There is none like that; give it me. 
21:10: And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
21:11: And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land?  did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands? 
21:12: And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath. 
21:13: And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.
21:14: Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?
21:15: Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence?  shall this fellow come into my house?
22:1: David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.
22:2: And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.
22:3: And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.
22:4: And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.
22:5: And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah.  Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.
22:6: When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)
22:7: Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;
22:8: That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
22:9: Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
22:10: And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
22:11: Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.
22:12: And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub.  And he answered, Here I am, my lord.
22:13: And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
22:14: Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?
22:15: Did I then begin to enquire of God for him?  be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.
22:16: And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house. 
22:17: And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me.  But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.
22:18: And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.  And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. 
22:19: And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword. 
22:20: And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.
22:21: And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests.
22:22: And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.
22:23: Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.
23:1: Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.
23:2: Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines?  And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.
23:3: And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
23:4: Then David enquired of the LORD yet again.  And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.
23:5: So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter.  So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
23:6: And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.
23:7: And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah.  And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.
23:8: And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
23:9: And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.
23:10: Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
