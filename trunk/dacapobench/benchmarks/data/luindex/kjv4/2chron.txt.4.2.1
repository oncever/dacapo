10:5: And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days.  And the people departed.
10:6: And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?
10:7: And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.
10:8: But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.
10:9: And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?
10:10: And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
10:11: For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
10:12: So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.
10:13: And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
10:14: And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
10:15: So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
10:16: And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?  and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house.  So all Israel went to their tents.
10:17: But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
10:18: Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.  But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
10:19: And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
11:1: And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.
11:2: But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 
11:3: Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
11:4: Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me.  And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam. 
11:5: And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah. 
11:6: He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
11:7: And Beth-zur, and Shoco, and Adullam,
11:8: And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
11:9: And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
11:10: And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities.
11:11: And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.
11:12: And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
11:13: And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.
11:14: For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the LORD:
11:15: And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.
11:16: And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.
11:17: So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.
11:18: And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;
11:19: Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
11:20: And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
11:21: And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)
11:22: And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.
11:23: And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance.  And he desired many wives.
12:1: And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him. 
12:2: And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,
12:3: With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians. 
12:4: And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem. 
12:5: Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
12:6: Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.
12:7: And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
12:8: Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
12:9: So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
12:10: Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.
12:11: And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.
12:12: And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.
12:13: So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.  And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
12:14: And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.
12:15: Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies?  And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
12:16: And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.
13:1: Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.
13:2: He reigned three years in Jerusalem.  His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.  And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
13:3: And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.
13:4: And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;
13:5: Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
13:6: Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.
13:7: And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them. 
13:8: And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.
13:9: Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands?  so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods. 
13:10: But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business: 
13:11: And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.
13:12: And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you.  O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.
13:13: But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.
13:14: And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
13:15: Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 
13:16: And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.
13:17: And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men. 
13:18: Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers. 
13:19: And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshnah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.
13:20: Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.
13:21: But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
13:22: And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.
14:1: So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.  In his days the land was quiet ten years.
14:2: And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:
14:3: For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:
14:4: And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.
14:5: Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.
14:6: And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.
14:7: Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side.  So they built and prospered.
14:8: And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.
14:9: And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.
14:10: Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
14:11: And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude.  O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.
14:12: So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
14:13: And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.
14:14: And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.
14:15: They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem. 
15:1: And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded: 
15:2: And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you. 
15:3: Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.
15:4: But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.
15:5: And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.
15:6: And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.
15:7: Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.
15:8: And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.
15:9: And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.
15:10: So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
15:11: And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
15:12: And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
15:13: That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
15:14: And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
15:15: And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.
15:16: And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
15:17: But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
15:18: And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.
15:19: And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.
16:1: In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
16:2: Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, 
16:3: There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
16:4: And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali. 
16:5: And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease. 
16:6: Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
16:7: And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.
16:8: Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen?  yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.
16:9: For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.  Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.
16:10: Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing.  And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.
16:11: And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
16:12: And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.
16:13: And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.
16:14: And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him.
17:1: And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.
17:2: And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.
17:3: And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;
17:4: But sought to the LORD God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.
17:5: Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance.
17:6: And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.
17:7: Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Ben-hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.
17:8: And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests.
17:9: And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.
17:10: And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat. 
17:11: Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.
17:12: And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store. 
17:13: And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem. 
17:14: And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.
17:15: And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand.
17:16: And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour.
17:17: And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.
17:18: And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war. 
17:19: These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah.
18:1: Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab. 
18:2: And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria.  And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth-gilead.
18:3: And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead?  And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.
18:4: And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.
18:5: Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?  And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.
18:6: But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?
18:7: And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla.  And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
18:8: And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
18:9: And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
18:10: And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.
18:11: And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
18:12: And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.
18:13: And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.
18:14: And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?  And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.
18:15: And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?
18:16: Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.
18:17: And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?
18:18: Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.
18:19: And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?  And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
18:20: Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him.  And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?
18:21: And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.  And the LORD said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so. 
18:22: Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.
18:23: Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee? 
18:24: And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. 
18:25: Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
18:26: And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
18:27: And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the LORD spoken by me.  And he said, Hearken, all ye people.
18:28: So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
18:29: And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes.  So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.
18:30: Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.
18:31: And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel.  Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.
18:32: For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.
18:33: And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
18:34: And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.
19:1: And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.
19:2: And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD?  therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD.
19:3: Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.
19:4: And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.
19:5: And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,
19:6: And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.
19:7: Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.
19:8: Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem.
19:9: And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart. 
19:10: And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.
19:11: And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you.  Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the good. 
20:1: It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.
20:2: Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they be Hazazon-tamar, which is En-gedi.
20:3: And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
20:4: And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD.
20:5: And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,
20:6: And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven?  and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen?  and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?
20:7: Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?
20:8: And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,
20:9: If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.
20:10: And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;
20:11: Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.
20:12: O our God, wilt thou not judge them?  for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.
20:13: And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
20:14: Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;
20:15: And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.
20:16: To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.
20:17: Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you.
20:18: And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD.
20:19: And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.
20:20: And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.
20:21: And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever.
20:22: And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.
20:23: For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.
20:24: And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped. 
20:25: And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.
20:26: And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day. 
20:27: Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies. 
20:28: And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD.
20:29: And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.
20:30: So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.
20:31: And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
20:32: And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.
20:33: Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.
20:34: Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.
20:35: And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:
20:36: And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.
20:37: Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works.  And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.
21:1: Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David.  And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
21:2: And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
21:3: And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.
21:4: Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.
21:5: Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
21:6: And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.
21:7: Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.
21:8: In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.
21:9: Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots. 
21:10: So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.  The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.
21:11: Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto. 
21:12: And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah, 
21:13: But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better than thyself:
21:14: Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:
21:15: And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.
21:16: Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:
21:17: And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
21:18: And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.
21:19: And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases.  And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.
21:20: Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired.  Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.
22:1: And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest.  So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
22:2: Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem.  His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.
22:3: He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counseller to do wickedly.
22:4: Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellers after the death of his father to his destruction.
22:5: He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.
22:6: And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.  And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.
22:7: And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
22:8: And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.
22:9: And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart.  So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.
22:10: But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.
22:11: But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber.  So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not. 
22:12: And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.
23:1: And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him. 
23:2: And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
23:3: And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God.  And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.
23:4: This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors;
23:5: And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.
23:6: But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.
23:7: And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.
23:8: So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.
23:9: Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God.
23:10: And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.
23:11: Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king.  And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.
23:12: Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:
23:13: And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise.  Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.
23:14: Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword.  For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.
23:15: So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.
23:16: And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD's people.
23:17: Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. 
23:18: Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.
23:19: And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in. 
23:20: And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom. 
23:21: And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.
24:1: Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem.  His mother's name also was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
24:2: And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
24:3: And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.
24:4: And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.
24:5: And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter.  Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.
24:6: And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?
24:7: For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.
24:8: And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.
24:9: And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.
24:10: And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
24:11: Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again.  Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
24:12: And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.
24:13: So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.
24:14: And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver.  And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.
24:15: But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.
24:16: And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.
24:17: Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king.  Then the king hearkened unto them.
24:18: And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass. 
24:19: Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.
24:20: And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper?  because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you. 
24:21: And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD. 
24:22: Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son.  And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.
24:23: And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.
24:24: For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.  So they executed judgment against Joash.
24:25: And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.
24:26: And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.
24:27: Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings.  And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
25:1: Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
25:2: And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.
25:3: Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.
25:4: But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.
25:5: Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.
25:6: He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.
25:7: But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.
25:8: But if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.
25:9: And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?  And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.
25:10: Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.
25:11: And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.
25:12: And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.
25:13: But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil. 
25:14: Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.
25:15: Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand? 
25:16: And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel?  forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten?  Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel. 
25:17: Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.
25:18: And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.
25:19: Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
25:20: But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.
25:21: So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
25:22: And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.
25:23: And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
25:24: And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
25:25: And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
25:26: Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
25:27: Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.
25:28: And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
26:1: Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah. 
26:2: He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
26:3: Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem.  His mother's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 
26:4: And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did. 
26:5: And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.
26:6: And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
26:7: And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Mehunims.
26:8: And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly.
26:9: Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.
26:10: Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.
26:11: Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.
26:12: The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred.
26:13: And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
26:14: And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.
26:15: And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal.  And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.
26:16: But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
26:17: And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:
26:18: And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God.
26:19: Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.
26:20: And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.
26:21: And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.
26:22: Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.
26:23: So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
27:1: Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.  His mother's name also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.
27:2: And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD.  And the people did yet corruptly. 
27:3: He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much. 
27:4: Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.
27:5: He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them.  And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley.  So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.
27:6: So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.
27:7: Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
27:8: He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
27:9: And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
28:1: Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:
28:2: For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.
28:3: Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
28:4: He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
28:5: Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus.  And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.
28:6: For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.
28:7: And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.
28:8: And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
28:9: But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven.
28:10: And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?
28:11: Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.
28:12: Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,
28:13: And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel. 
28:14: So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.
28:15: And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria. 
28:16: At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him. 
28:17: For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.
28:18: The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.
28:19: For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.
28:20: And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
28:21: For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.
28:22: And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.
28:23: For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me.  But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
28:24: And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
28:25: And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.
28:26: Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
28:27: And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
29:1: Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
29:2: And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.
29:3: He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.
29:4: And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street,
29:5: And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.
29:6: For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.
29:7: Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.
29:8: Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.
29:9: For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. 
29:10: Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.
29:11: My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense. 
29:12: Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah: 
29:13: And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:
29:14: And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.
29:15: And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.
29:16: And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD.  And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.
29:17: Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
29:18: Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof.
29:19: Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the LORD.
29:20: Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.
