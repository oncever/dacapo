FIRST SAMUEL
1:1: Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
1:2: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. 
1:3: And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh.  And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.
1:4: And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: 
1:5: But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb. 
1:6: And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.
1:7: And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
1:8: Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou?  and why eatest thou not?  and why is thy heart grieved?  am not I better to thee than ten sons?
1:9: So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk.  Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.
1:10: And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.
1:11: And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
1:12: And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.
1:13: Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
1:14: And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken?  put away thy wine from thee.
1:15: And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.
1:16: Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
1:17: Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
1:18: And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight.  So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.
1:19: And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.
1:20: Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.
1:21: And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
1:22: But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.
1:23: And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word.  So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.
1:24: And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.
1:25: And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli. 
1:26: And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.
1:27: For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him: 
1:28: Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD.  And he worshipped the LORD there. 
2:1: And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.
2:2: There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.
2:3: Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
2:4: The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
2:5: They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
2:6: The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
2:7: The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.
2:8: He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.
2:9: He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
2:10: The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.
2:11: And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house.  And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.
2:12: Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.
2:13: And the priests' custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;
2:14: And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself.  So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.
2:15: Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.
2:16: And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.
2:17: Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.
2:18: But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
2:19: Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 
2:20: And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD.  And they went unto their own home.
2:21: And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters.  And the child Samuel grew before the LORD. 
2:22: Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
2:23: And he said unto them, Why do ye such things?  for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.
2:24: Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgress.
2:25: If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him?  Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.
2:26: And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.
2:27: And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?
2:28: And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me?  and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
2:29: Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
2:30: Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
2:31: Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.
2:32: And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.
2:33: And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.
2:34: And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.
2:35: And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.
2:36: And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.
3:1: And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli.  And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.
3:2: And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;
3:3: And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;
3:4: That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.
3:5: And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me.  And he said, I called not; lie down again.  And he went and lay down. 
3:6: And the LORD called yet again, Samuel.  And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me.  And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
3:7: Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. 
3:8: And the LORD called Samuel again the third time.  And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me.  And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child. 
3:9: Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth.  So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
3:10: And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel.  Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
3:11: And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
3:12: In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.
3:13: For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
3:14: And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. 
3:15: And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD.  And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.
3:16: Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son.  And he answered, Here am I. 
3:17: And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee?  I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee. 
3:18: And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him.  And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.
3:19: And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
3:20: And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.
3:21: And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
4:1: And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.  Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.
4:2: And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
4:3: And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines?  Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.
4:4: So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
4:5: And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
4:6: And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?  And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.
4:7: And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp.  And they said, Woe unto us!  for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.
4:8: Woe unto us!  who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods?  these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
4:9: Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
4:10: And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
4:11: And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
4:12: And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.
4:13: And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God.  And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.
4:14: And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult?  And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.
4:15: Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see. 
4:16: And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army.  And he said, What is there done, my son?
4:17: And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken. 
4:18: And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy.  And he had judged Israel forty years. 
4:19: And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.
4:20: And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son.  But she answered not, neither did she regard it.
4:21: And she named the child I-chabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.
4:22: And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.
5:1: And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod.
5:2: When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
5:3: And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD.  And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
5:4: And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.
5:5: Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.
5:6: But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.
5:7: And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.
5:8: They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?  And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath.  And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.
5:9: And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.
5:10: Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron.  And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.
5:11: So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
5:12: And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
6:1: And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
6:2: And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD?  tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place. 
6:3: And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
6:4: Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him?  They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords. 
6:5: Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land. 
6:6: Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts?  when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
6:7: Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:
6:8: And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.
6:9: And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.
6:10: And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:
6:11: And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.
6:12: And the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh.
6:13: And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.
6:14: And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD.
6:15: And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.
6:16: And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.
6:17: And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
6:18: And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Beth-shemite.
6:19: And he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.
6:20: And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God?  and to whom shall he go up from us?
6:21: And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.
7:1: And the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.
7:2: And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.
7:3: And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines. 
7:4: Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.
7:5: And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD. 
7:6: And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD.  And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh. 
7:7: And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel.  And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
7:8: And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.
7:9: And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.
7:10: And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.
7:11: And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car.
7:12: Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.
7:13: So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
7:14: And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines.  And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
7:15: And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
7:16: And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.
7:17: And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.
8:1: And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
8:2: Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beer-sheba.
8:3: And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
8:4: Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,
8:5: And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.
8:6: But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us.  And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.
8:7: And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.
8:8: According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. 
8:9: Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.
8:10: And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king. 
8:11: And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. 
8:12: And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.
8:13: And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
8:14: And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.
8:15: And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
8:16: And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.
8:17: He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.
8:18: And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.
8:19: Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;
8:20: That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
8:21: And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.
8:22: And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king.  And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.
9:1: Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.
9:2: And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.
9:3: And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost.  And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.
9:4: And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.
9:5: And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.
9:6: And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.
9:7: Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man?  for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?
9:8: And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. 
9:9: (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)
9:10: Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go.  So they went unto the city where the man of God was. 
9:11: And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here? 
9:12: And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:
9:13: As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden.  Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.
9:14: And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.
9:15: Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,
9:16: To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.
9:17: And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of!  this same shall reign over my people.
9:18: Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.
9:19: And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.
9:20: And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found.  And on whom is all the desire of Israel?  Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?
9:21: And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel?  and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin?  wherefore then speakest thou so to me?
9:22: And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.
9:23: And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.
9:24: And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul.  And Samuel said, Behold that which is left!  set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people.  So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
9:25: And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.
9:26: And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away.  And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
9:27: And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.
10:1: Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?
10:2: When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
10:3: Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
10:4: And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.
10:5: After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:
10:6: And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man. 
10:7: And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.
10:8: And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do. 
10:9: And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day. 
10:10: And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.
10:11: And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish?  Is Saul also among the prophets?
10:12: And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father?  Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
10:13: And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
10:14: And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye?  And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.
10:15: And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.
10:16: And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found.  But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.
10:17: And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;
10:18: And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:
10:19: And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us.  Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.
10:20: And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
10:21: When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.
10:22: Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither.  And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.
10:23: And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
10:24: And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?  And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.
10:25: Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD.  And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
10:26: And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.
10:27: But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us?  And they despised him, and brought him no presents.  But he held his peace.
11:1: Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee. 
11:2: And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
11:3: And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee. 
11:4: Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept. 
11:5: And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep?  And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.
11:6: And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.
11:7: And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen.  And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.
11:8: And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
11:9: And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help.  And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
11:10: Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.
11:11: And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.
11:12: And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us?  bring the men, that we may put them to death.
11:13: And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.
11:14: Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
11:15: And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
12:1: And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.
12:2: And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.
12:3: Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken?  or whose ass have I taken?  or whom have I defrauded?  whom have I oppressed?  or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith?  and I will restore it you.
12:4: And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.
12:5: And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand.  And they answered, He is witness.
12:6: And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
12:7: Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.
12:8: When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place. 
12:9: And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
12:10: And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee. 
12:11: And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe. 
12:12: And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.
12:13: Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired!  and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.
12:14: If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:
12:15: But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.
12:16: Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.
12:17: Is it not wheat harvest to day?  I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.
12:18: So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
12:19: And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.
12:20: And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;
12:21: And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.
12:22: For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.
12:23: Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:
12:24: Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.
12:25: But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.
13:1: Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
13:2: Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
13:3: And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it.  And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
13:4: And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines.  And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
13:5: And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.
13:6: When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
13:7: And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead.  As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. 
13:8: And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
13:9: And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings.  And he offered the burnt offering. 
13:10: And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. 
13:11: And Samuel said, What hast thou done?  And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;
13:12: Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.
13:13: And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.
13:14: But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.
13:15: And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin.  And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.
13:16: And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
13:17: And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:
13:18: And another company turned the way to Beth-horon: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
13:19: Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:
13:20: But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.
13:21: Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
13:22: So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
13:23: And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
14:1: Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side.  But he told not his father.
14:2: And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;
14:3: And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I-chabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod.  And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
14:4: And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
14:5: The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.
14:6: And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few. 
14:7: And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.
14:8: Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them. 
14:9: If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. 
14:10: But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.
14:11: And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
14:12: And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing.  And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.
14:13: And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.
14:14: And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.
14:15: And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.
14:16: And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.
14:17: Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us.  And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.
14:18: And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God.  For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
14:19: And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.
14:20: And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.
14:21: Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
14:22: Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
14:23: So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Beth-aven.
14:24: And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies.  So none of the people tasted any food.
14:25: And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.
14:26: And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.
14:27: But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
14:28: Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day.  And the people were faint.
14:29: Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey. 
14:30: How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found?  for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
14:31: And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint. 
14:32: And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood. 
14:33: Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood.  And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.
14:34: And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood.  And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.
14:35: And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.
14:36: And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.  And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee.  Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.
14:37: And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines?  wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?  But he answered him not that day.
14:38: And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.
14:39: For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.  But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.
14:40: Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.  And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.
14:41: Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot.  And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.
14:42: And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.  And Jonathan was taken.
14:43: Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done.  And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.
14:44: And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.
14:45: And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel?  God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day.  So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
14:46: Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
14:47: So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.
14:48: And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.
14:49: Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
14:50: And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
14:51: And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
14:52: And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him. 
15:1: Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD. 
15:2: Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. 
15:3: Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
15:4: And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
15:5: And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
15:6: And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.  So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
15:7: And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.
15:8: And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
15:9: But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
15:10: Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,
15:11: It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments.  And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.
15:12: And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
15:13: And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.
15:14: And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
15:15: And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
15:16: Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night.  And he said unto him, Say on.
15:17: And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?
15:18: And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
15:19: Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?
15:20: And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
15:21: But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.
15:22: And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD?  Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. 
15:23: For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.  Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.
15:24: And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice. 
15:25: Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD. 
15:26: And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.
15:27: And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
15:28: And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.
15:29: And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.
15:30: Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.
15:31: So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.
15:32: Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.  And Agag came unto him delicately.  And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
15:33: And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women.  And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.
15:34: Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
15:35: And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
16:1: And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?  fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.
16:2: And Samuel said, How can I go?  if Saul hear it, he Will kill me.  And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.
16:3: And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.
16:4: And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem.  And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?
16:5: And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.  And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
16:6: And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.
16:7: But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.
16:8: Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.  And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
16:9: Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by.  And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. 
16:10: Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel.  And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.
16:11: And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children?  And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep.  And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither. 
16:12: And he sent, and brought him in.  Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to.  And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he. 
16:13: Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward.  So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
16:14: But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.
16:15: And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
16:16: Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
16:17: And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
16:18: Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.
16:19: Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep.
16:20: And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.
16:21: And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.
16:22: And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.
