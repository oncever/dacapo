2:16: And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:

2:19: Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;
2:20: And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;

3:1: For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
3:2: If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:
3:3: How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,
3:4: Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)
3:5: Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
3:6: That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:

3:10: To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
3:11: According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
3:12: In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.

3:17: That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
3:18: May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
3:19: And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.
3:20: Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,

4:2: With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;
4:3: Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
