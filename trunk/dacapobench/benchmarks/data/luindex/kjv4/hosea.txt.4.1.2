8:5: Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?
8:6: For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
8:7: For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.
8:8: Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.
8:9: For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.

9:3: They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.
9:4: They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.
9:5: What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?
9:6: For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles.

9:17: My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
10:1: Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.
10:2: Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.
10:3: For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?

10:10: It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.
10:11: And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods. 
10:12: Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.
10:13: Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men. 
10:14: Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children. 
10:15: So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.
