 1:12: Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.
 1:13: I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:
 1:14: But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.
