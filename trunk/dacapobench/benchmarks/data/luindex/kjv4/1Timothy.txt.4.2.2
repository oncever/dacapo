4:5: For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
4:6: If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.
4:7: But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.
4:8: For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
4:9: This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
4:10: For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.
4:11: These things command and teach.
4:12: Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
4:13: Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
4:14: Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
4:15: Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
4:16: Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
5:1: Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;
5:2: The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.
5:3: Honour widows that are widows indeed.
5:4: But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.
5:5: Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.
5:6: But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
5:7: And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.
5:8: But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
5:9: Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,
5:10: Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.
5:11: But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;
5:12: Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.
5:13: And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
5:14: I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.
5:15: For some are already turned aside after Satan.
5:16: If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.
5:17: Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.
5:18: For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.
5:19: Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.
5:20: Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.
5:21: I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.
5:22: Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure.
5:23: Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities.
5:24: Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.
5:25: Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
6:1: Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.
6:2: And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.
6:3: If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;
6:4: He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
6:5: Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.
6:6: But godliness with contentment is great gain.
6:7: For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.
6:8: And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
6:9: But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.
6:10: For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
6:11: But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
6:12: Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.
6:13: I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;
6:14: That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
6:15: Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
6:16: Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.
6:17: Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
6:18: That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
6:19: Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
