   10:13: There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.
   10:14: Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
   10:15: I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
   10:16: The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
   10:17: For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.
   10:18: Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
   10:19: What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?
   10:20: But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.
   10:21: Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.
   10:22: Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
   10:23: All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.
   10:24: Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.
   10:25: Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:
   10:26: For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.
   10:27: If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.
   10:28: But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:
   10:29: Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?
   10:30: For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
   10:31: Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
   10:32: Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:
   10:33: Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.
   11:1: Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.
   11:2: Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.
   11:3: But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
   11:4: Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.
   11:5: But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
   11:6: For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
   11:7: For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
   11:8: For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
   11:9: Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
   11:10: For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.
   11:11: Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.
   11:12: For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
   11:13: Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
   11:14: Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
   11:15: But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.
   11:16: But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
   11:17: Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
   11:18: For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
   11:19: For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.
   11:20: When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.
   11:21: For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
   11:22: What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.
   11:23: For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:
   11:24: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
   11:25: After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
   11:26: For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.
   11:27: Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
   11:28: But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.
   11:29: For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
   11:30: For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
   11:31: For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
   11:32: But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
   11:33: Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.
   11:34: And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
   12:1: Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
   12:2: Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.
   12:3: Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
   12:4: Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
   12:5: And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
   12:6: And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.
   12:7: But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
   12:8: For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
   12:9: To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
   12:10: To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
   12:11: But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
   12:12: For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.
   12:13: For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
   12:14: For the body is not one member, but many.
   12:15: If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
   12:16: And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
   12:17: If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
   12:18: But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.
   12:19: And if they were all one member, where were the body?
   12:20: But now are they many members, yet but one body.
   12:21: And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
   12:22: Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:
   12:23: And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.
   12:24: For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:
   12:25: That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.
   12:26: And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
   12:27: Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
   12:28: And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
   12:29: Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?
   12:30: Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
   12:31: But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
   13:1: Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
   13:2: And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
   13:3: And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
   13:4: Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
   13:5: Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
   13:6: Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
   13:7: Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
   13:8: Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
   13:9: For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
   13:10: But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
   13:11: When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
   13:12: For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
   13:13: And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.
   14:1: Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.
   14:2: For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.
   14:3: But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.
   14:4: He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
   14:5: I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
   14:6: Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?
   14:7: And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
   14:8: For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?
   14:9: So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.
   14:10: There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.
