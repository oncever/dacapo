 3:13: Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
 3:14: We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.
 3:15: Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
 3:16: Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
 3:17: But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
 3:18: My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.
 3:19: And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
 3:20: For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
 3:21: Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.
 3:22: And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
 3:23: And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.
 3:24: And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.
 4:1: Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
 4:2: Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:
 4:3: And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.
 4:4: Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.
 4:5: They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.
 4:6: We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
 4:7: Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
 4:8: He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
 4:9: In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
 4:10: Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
 4:11: Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
 4:12: No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
 4:13: Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
 4:14: And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
