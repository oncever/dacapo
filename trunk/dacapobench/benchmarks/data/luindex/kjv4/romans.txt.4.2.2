  8:30: Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
  8:31: What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?
  8:32: He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
  8:33: Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.
  8:34: Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
  8:35: Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
  8:36: As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
  8:37: Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
  8:38: For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
  8:39: Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
  9:1: I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,
  9:2: That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
  9:3: For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
  9:4: Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;
  9:5: Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
  9:6: Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:
  9:7: Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
  9:8: That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.
  9:9: For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.
  9:10: And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;
  9:11: (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)
  9:12: It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
  9:13: As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
  9:14: What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
  9:15: For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
  9:16: So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.
  9:17: For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
  9:18: Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.
  9:19: Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?
  9:20: Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?
  9:21: Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?
  9:22: What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:
  9:23: And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,
  9:24: Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?
  9:25: As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.
  9:26: And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.
  9:27: Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:
  9:28: For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.
  9:29: And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.
  9:30: What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.
  9:31: But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
  9:32: Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;
  9:33: As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
  10:1: Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.
  10:2: For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
  10:3: For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.
  10:4: For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
  10:5: For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.
  10:6: But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)
  10:7: Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)
  10:8: But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;
  10:9: That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
  10:10: For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
  10:11: For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
  10:12: For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
  10:13: For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
  10:14: How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
  10:15: And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
  10:16: But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?
  10:17: So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
  10:18: But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
  10:19: But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.
  10:20: But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.
  10:21: But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.
  11:1: I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
  11:2: God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,
  11:3: Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
  11:4: But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.
  11:5: Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
  11:6: And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
  11:7: What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded
  11:8: (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.
  11:9: And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:
  11:10: Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.
  11:11: I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.
  11:12: Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?
  11:13: For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:
  11:14: If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.
  11:15: For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?
  11:16: For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.
  11:17: And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
  11:18: Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
  11:19: Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.
  11:20: Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
  11:21: For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.
  11:22: Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
  11:23: And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.
  11:24: For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?
  11:25: For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
  11:26: And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
  11:27: For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.
  11:28: As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.
  11:29: For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
  11:30: For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:
  11:31: Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
  11:32: For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.
  11:33: O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
  11:34: For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?
  11:35: Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
  11:36: For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.
  12:1: I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
  12:2: And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
  12:3: For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
  12:4: For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:
  12:5: So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.
  12:6: Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
  12:7: Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;
  12:8: Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.
  12:9: Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
  12:10: Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
  12:11: Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
  12:12: Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
  12:13: Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
  12:14: Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
  12:15: Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
  12:16: Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.
  12:17: Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.
  12:18: If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.
  12:19: Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.
  12:20: Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.
  12:21: Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
  13:1: Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
  13:2: Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.
  13:3: For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:
  13:4: For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.
  13:5: Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.
  13:6: For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.
  13:7: Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
  13:8: Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
  13:9: For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
  13:10: Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
  13:11: And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.
  13:12: The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
  13:13: Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.
  13:14: But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.
  14:1: Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.
  14:2: For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.
  14:3: Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.
  14:4: Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.
  14:5: One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
  14:6: He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
  14:7: For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
  14:8: For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.
  14:9: For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.
  14:10: But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
  14:11: For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
  14:12: So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
  14:13: Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.
  14:14: I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
  14:15: But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.
  14:16: Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
  14:17: For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
  14:18: For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.
  14:19: Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.
  14:20: For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.
  14:21: It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.
  14:22: Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
  14:23: And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
  15:1: We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
  15:2: Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.
  15:3: For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.
  15:4: For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
  15:5: Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:
  15:6: That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
  15:7: Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.
  15:8: Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:
  15:9: And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.
  15:10: And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
  15:11: And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.
  15:12: And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.
  15:13: Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.
  15:14: And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
  15:15: Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,
  15:16: That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
  15:17: I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.
  15:18: For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,
  15:19: Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
  15:20: Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:
  15:21: But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.
  15:22: For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.
  15:23: But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;
  15:24: Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.
  15:25: But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
  15:26: For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.
  15:27: It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.
  15:28: When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.
  15:29: And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
  15:30: Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;
  15:31: That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;
  15:32: That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.
  15:33: Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
  16:1: I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:
  16:2: That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.
  16:3: Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:
  16:4: Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.
  16:5: Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my wellbeloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.
  16:6: Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.
  16:7: Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.
  16:8: Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.
  16:9: Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
  16:10: Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household.
  16:11: Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.
  16:12: Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.
  16:13: Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
  16:14: Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.
  16:15: Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.
  16:16: Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.
  16:17: Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.
  16:18: For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.
  16:19: For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.
  16:20: And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
  16:21: Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.
  16:22: I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.
  16:23: Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.
  16:24: The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
  16:25: Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,
