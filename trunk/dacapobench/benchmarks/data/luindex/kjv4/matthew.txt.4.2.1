9:33: And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.
9:34: But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.
9:35: And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
9:36: But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
9:37: Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;
9:38: Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.
10:1: And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.
10:2: Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
10:3: Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;
10:4: Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
10:5: These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:
10:6: But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
10:7: And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
10:8: Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.
10:9: Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,
10:10: Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.
10:11: And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.
10:12: And when ye come into an house, salute it.
10:13: And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.
10:14: And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.
10:15: Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
10:16: Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
10:17: But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;
10:18: And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.
10:19: But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.
10:20: For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.
10:21: And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.
10:22: And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.
10:23: But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.
10:24: The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.
10:25: It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?
10:26: Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
10:27: What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.
10:28: And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
10:29: Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
10:30: But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
10:31: Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.
10:32: Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.
10:33: But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.
10:34: Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
10:35: For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.
10:36: And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.
10:37: He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
10:38: And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.
10:39: He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.
10:40: He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
10:41: He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.
10:42: And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
11:1: And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.
11:2: Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
11:3: And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?
11:4: Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:
11:5: The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
11:6: And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.
11:7: And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
11:8: But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.
11:9: But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.
11:10: For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
11:11: Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
11:12: And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.
11:13: For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
11:14: And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.
11:15: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
11:16: But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,
11:17: And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.
11:18: For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.
11:19: The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.
11:20: Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:
11:21: Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
11:22: But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.
11:23: And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
11:24: But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.
11:25: At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.
11:26: Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.
11:27: All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.
11:28: Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
11:29: Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
11:30: For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
12:1: At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.
12:2: But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.
12:3: But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;
12:4: How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?
12:5: Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?
12:6: But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.
12:7: But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.
12:8: For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.
12:9: And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:
12:10: And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.
12:11: And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?
12:12: How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.
12:13: Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.
12:14: Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.
12:15: But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;
12:16: And charged them that they should not make him known:
12:17: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
12:18: Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.
12:19: He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.
12:20: A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.
12:21: And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
12:22: Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.
12:23: And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?
12:24: But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.
12:25: And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:
12:26: And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?
12:27: And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.
12:28: But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.
12:29: Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.
12:30: He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.
12:31: Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.
12:32: And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.
12:33: Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.
12:34: O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
12:35: A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.
12:36: But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
12:37: For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
12:38: Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.
12:39: But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:
12:40: For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
12:41: The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.
12:42: The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
12:43: When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.
12:44: Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.
12:45: Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.
12:46: While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.
12:47: Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.
12:48: But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
12:49: And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
12:50: For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
13:1: The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
13:2: And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
13:3: And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;
13:4: And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:
13:5: Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:
13:6: And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
13:7: And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:
13:8: But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.
13:9: Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
13:10: And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
13:11: He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
13:12: For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.
13:13: Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
13:14: And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:
13:15: For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
13:16: But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.
13:17: For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.
13:18: Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
13:19: When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.
13:20: But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;
13:21: Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.
13:22: He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
13:23: But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
13:24: Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:
13:25: But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
13:26: But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
13:27: So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?
13:28: He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?
13:29: But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.
13:30: Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
13:31: Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:
13:32: Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.
13:33: Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
13:34: All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:
13:35: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
13:36: Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
13:37: He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
13:38: The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;
13:39: The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
13:40: As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
13:41: The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;
13:42: And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
13:43: Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
13:44: Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
13:45: Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:
13:46: Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
13:47: Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
13:48: Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.
13:49: So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,
13:50: And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
13:51: Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.
13:52: Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.
13:53: And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.
13:54: And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
13:55: Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
13:56: And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?
13:57: And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.
13:58: And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
14:1: At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
14:2: And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.
14:3: For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.
14:4: For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
14:5: And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
14:6: But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.
14:7: Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.
14:8: And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.
14:9: And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.
14:10: And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
14:11: And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.
14:12: And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
14:13: When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.
14:14: And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.
14:15: And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.
14:16: But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.
14:17: And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.
14:18: He said, Bring them hither to me.
14:19: And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
14:20: And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
14:21: And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.
14:22: And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
14:23: And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.
14:24: But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.
14:25: And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.
14:26: And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.
14:27: But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
14:28: And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.
14:29: And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.
14:30: But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.
14:31: And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
14:32: And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
14:33: Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.
14:34: And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.
14:35: And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;
14:36: And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
15:1: Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,
15:2: Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
15:3: But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?
15:4: For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
15:5: But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;
15:6: And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.
15:7: Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
15:8: This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
15:9: But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
15:10: And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:
15:11: Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
15:12: Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?
15:13: But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.
15:14: Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.
15:15: Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.
15:16: And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?
15:17: Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
15:18: But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.
15:19: For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:
15:20: These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.
15:21: Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
15:22: And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
15:23: But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
15:24: But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
15:25: Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
15:26: But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.
15:27: And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.
15:28: Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.
15:29: And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
15:30: And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:
15:31: Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
15:32: Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
15:33: And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
15:34: And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
15:35: And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
15:36: And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
15:37: And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.
15:38: And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.
15:39: And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
16:1: The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.
16:2: He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.
16:3: And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?
16:4: A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.
16:5: And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
16:6: Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
16:7: And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.
16:8: Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?
16:9: Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
16:10: Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
16:11: How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
16:12: Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
16:13: When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?
16:14: And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
16:15: He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
16:16: And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
16:17: And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.
16:18: And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
16:19: And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
16:20: Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.
16:21: From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.
16:22: Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.
16:23: But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.
16:24: Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
16:25: For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
16:26: For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
16:27: For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.
16:28: Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
17:1: And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,
17:2: And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.
17:3: And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.
17:4: Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
17:5: While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.
17:6: And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
17:7: And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
17:8: And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.
17:9: And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.
17:10: And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?
17:11: And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.
17:12: But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.
17:13: Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.
17:14: And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,
17:15: Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.
17:16: And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
17:17: Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.
17:18: And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.
17:19: Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?
17:20: And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
17:21: Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.
17:22: And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:
17:23: And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.
17:24: And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?
17:25: He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?
17:26: Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.
17:27: Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.
18:1: At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
18:2: And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,
18:3: And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
18:4: Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
18:5: And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.
18:6: But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
18:7: Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!
18:8: Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.
18:9: And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.
18:10: Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.
18:11: For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
18:12: How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?
18:13: And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.
18:14: Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
18:15: Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
18:16: But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
18:17: And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.
18:18: Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
18:19: Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.
18:20: For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
18:21: Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
18:22: Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.
18:23: Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.
18:24: And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.
18:25: But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
18:26: The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
18:27: Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.
18:28: But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.
18:29: And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
18:30: And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.
18:31: So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.
18:32: Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:
18:33: Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?
18:34: And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.
18:35: So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.
19:1: And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;
19:2: And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.
19:3: The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
19:4: And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,
19:5: And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?
19:6: Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
19:7: They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?
19:8: He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.
19:9: And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.
19:10: His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.
19:11: But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.
19:12: For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.
19:13: Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.
19:14: But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
19:15: And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.
19:16: And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
19:17: And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
19:18: He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
19:19: Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
19:20: The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?
19:21: Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.
19:22: But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
19:23: Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
19:24: And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
19:25: When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
19:26: But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
19:27: Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?
19:28: And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
19:29: And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.
19:30: But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
20:1: For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.
20:2: And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
20:3: And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
20:4: And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.
20:5: Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.
20:6: And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
20:7: They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.
20:8: So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.
20:9: And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.
20:10: But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.
20:11: And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,
20:12: Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.
20:13: But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?
20:14: Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.
20:15: Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?
20:16: So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.
20:17: And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,
20:18: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,
20:19: And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.
20:20: Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.
20:21: And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.
20:22: But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.
20:23: And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.
20:24: And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
20:25: But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.
20:26: But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;
20:27: And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:
20:28: Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
20:29: And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
20:30: And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David.
20:31: And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David.
20:32: And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?
20:33: They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
20:34: So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
21:1: And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,
21:2: Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.
21:3: And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.
21:4: All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
21:5: Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.
21:6: And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,
21:7: And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.
21:8: And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.
21:9: And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
21:10: And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?
21:11: And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
21:12: And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,
21:13: And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.
21:14: And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
21:15: And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased,
21:16: And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
21:17: And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.
21:18: Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.
21:19: And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.
21:20: And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!
21:21: Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.
21:22: And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
21:23: And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?
21:24: And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
21:25: The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?
21:26: But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.
21:27: And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
21:28: But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.
21:29: He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.
21:30: And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.
21:31: Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
21:32: For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.
21:33: Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:
21:34: And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.
21:35: And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
21:36: Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.
21:37: But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
21:38: But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.
21:39: And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.
21:40: When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?
21:41: They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
21:42: Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
21:43: Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
21:44: And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
21:45: And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.
21:46: But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.
22:1: And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,
22:2: The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,
22:3: And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.
22:4: Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.
22:5: But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:
22:6: And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.
22:7: But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
22:8: Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.
22:9: Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.
22:10: So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.
22:11: And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:
22:12: And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
22:13: Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
22:14: For many are called, but few are chosen.
22:15: Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.
22:16: And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.
22:17: Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
22:18: But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?
22:19: Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.
22:20: And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
22:21: They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.
22:22: When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.
22:23: The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,
22:24: Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
22:25: Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:
22:26: Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
22:27: And last of all the woman died also.
22:28: Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
22:29: Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
22:30: For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
22:31: But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,
22:32: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
22:33: And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.
22:34: But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.
22:35: Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,
22:36: Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
22:37: Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
22:38: This is the first and great commandment.
22:39: And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
22:40: On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
22:41: While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
22:42: Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The Son of David.
22:43: He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
22:44: The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?
22:45: If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?
22:46: And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
23:1: Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,
23:2: Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:
23:3: All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.
23:4: For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.
23:5: But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,
23:6: And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
23:7: And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
23:8: But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.
23:9: And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.
23:10: Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.
23:11: But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
23:12: And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
23:13: But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.
23:14: Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.
23:15: Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
23:16: Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
23:17: Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
23:18: And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.
23:19: Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
23:20: Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.
23:21: And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.
23:22: And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.
23:23: Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
23:24: Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.
23:25: Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
23:26: Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.
23:27: Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.
23:28: Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
23:29: Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,
