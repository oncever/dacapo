7:16: And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
7:17: According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. 
7:18: Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD?  and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
7:19: And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come.  And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?
7:20: And what can David say more unto thee?  for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.
7:21: For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.
7:22: Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 
7:23: And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?
7:24: For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God. 
7:25: And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said. 
7:26: And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.
7:27: For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.
7:28: And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:
7:29: Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.
8:1: And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.
8:2: And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive.  And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.
8:3: David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.
8:4: And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.
8:5: And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
8:6: Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts.  And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
8:7: And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
8:8: And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.
8:9: When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,
8:10: Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi.  And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:
8:11: Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;
8:12: Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
8:13: And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.
8:14: And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants.  And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
8:15: And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people. 
8:16: And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
8:17: And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe; 
8:18: And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers. 
9:1: And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?
9:2: And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba.  And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba?  And he said, Thy servant is he.
9:3: And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him?  And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.
9:4: And the king said unto him, Where is he?  And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.
9:5: Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.
9:6: Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence.  And David said, Mephibosheth.  And he answered, Behold thy servant!
9:7: And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.
9:8: And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?
9:9: Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.
9:10: Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table.  Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
9:11: Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do.  As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.
9:12: And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha.  And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.
9:13: So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.
10:1: And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
10:2: Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me.  And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father.  And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
10:3: And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee?  hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
10:4: Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
10:5: When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return. 
10:6: And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ish-tob twelve thousand men.
10:7: And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 
10:8: And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ish-tob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field. 
10:9: When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:
10:10: And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.
10:11: And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.
10:12: Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.
10:13: And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.
10:14: And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city.  So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
10:15: And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.
10:16: And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.
10:17: And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam.  And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
10:18: And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.
10:19: And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them.  So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.
11:1: And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah.  But David tarried still at Jerusalem.
11:2: And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.
11:3: And David sent and enquired after the woman.  And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
11:4: And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.
11:5: And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.
11:6: And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite.  And Joab sent Uriah to David.
11:7: And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.
11:8: And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.  And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king. 
11:9: But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
11:10: And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey?  why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?
11:11: And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife?  as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
11:12: And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart.  So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.
11:13: And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
11:14: And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. 
11:15: And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.
11:16: And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were. 
11:17: And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also. 
11:18: Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
11:19: And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,
11:20: And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight?  knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?
11:21: Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth?  did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez?  why went ye nigh the wall?  then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
11:22: So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.
11:23: And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.
11:24: And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
11:25: Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.
11:26: And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.
11:27: And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son.  But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.
12:1: And the LORD sent Nathan unto David.  And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
12:2: The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:
12:3: But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.
12:4: And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
12:5: And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die:
12:6: And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
12:7: And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man.  Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;
12:8: And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.
12:9: Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight?  thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. 
12:10: Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
12:11: Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. 
12:12: For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun. 
12:13: And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD.  And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
12:14: Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.
12:15: And Nathan departed unto his house.  And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.
12:16: David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.
12:17: And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
12:18: And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died.  And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?
12:19: But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead?  And they said, He is dead.
12:20: Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.
12:21: Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done?  thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
12:22: And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
12:23: But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast?  can I bring him back again?  I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
12:24: And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.
12:25: And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
12:26: And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
12:27: And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.
12:28: Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
12:29: And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
12:30: And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head.  And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
12:31: And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon.  So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.
13:1: And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
13:2: And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her. 
13:3: But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man. 
13:4: And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day?  wilt thou not tell me?  And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
13:5: And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.
13:6: So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.
13:7: Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.
13:8: So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down.  And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.
13:9: And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat.  And Amnon said, Have out all men from me.  And they went out every man from him.
13:10: And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand.  And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
13:11: And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.
13:12: And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.
13:13: And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go?  and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel.  Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.
13:14: Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.
13:15: Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her.  And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.
13:16: And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me.  But he would not hearken unto her.
13:17: Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
13:18: And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled.  Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
13:19: And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.
13:20: And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee?  but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing.  So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
13:21: But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
13:22: And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
13:23: And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
13:24: And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.
13:25: And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee.  And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.
13:26: Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us.  And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee? 
13:27: But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
13:28: Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you?  be courageous and be valiant. 
13:29: And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded.  Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled. 
13:30: And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.
13:31: Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.
13:32: And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
13:33: Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.
13:34: But Absalom fled.  And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.
13:35: And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.
13:36: And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
13:37: But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur.  And David mourned for his son every day.
13:38: So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
13:39: And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.
14:1: Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.
14:2: And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:
14:3: And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him.  So Joab put the words in her mouth.
14:4: And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.
14:5: And the king said unto her, What aileth thee?  And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.
14:6: And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.
14:7: And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.
14:8: And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.
14:9: And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless. 
14:10: And the king said, Whosoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
14:11: Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son.  And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth. 
14:12: Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king.  And he said, Say on. 
14:13: And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God?  for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.
