 1:18: How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.
 1:19: These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.
 1:20: But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,
 1:21: Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
 1:22: And of some have compassion, making a difference:
 1:23: And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
