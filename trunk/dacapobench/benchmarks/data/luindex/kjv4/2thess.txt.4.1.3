3:7: For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
3:8: Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:
3:9: Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.
3:10: For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.
3:11: For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.
3:12: Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
3:13: But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
3:14: And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.
3:15: Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
3:16: Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.
3:17: The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.
3:18: The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
