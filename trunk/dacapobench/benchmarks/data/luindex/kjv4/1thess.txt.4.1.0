FIRST THESSALONIANS
 1:1: Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1:2: We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;
1:3: Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;
1:4: Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.
1:5: For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.
1:6: And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:
1:7: So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
1:8: For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.
1:9: For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;
1:10: And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.
2:1: For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:
2:2: But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.
2:3: For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:
2:4: But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.
2:5: For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:
2:6: Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.
2:7: But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:
2:8: So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.
2:9: For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.
2:10: Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:
2:11: As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,
