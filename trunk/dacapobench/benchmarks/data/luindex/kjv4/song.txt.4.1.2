4:13: Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,
4:14: Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:
4:15: A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.
4:16: Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.  Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.
5:1: I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. 
5:2: I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.
5:3: I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?  I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them? 
5:4: My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him. 
5:5: I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
5:6: I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
5:7: The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
5:8: I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.
5:9: What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women?  what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?
5:10: My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.
5:11: His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.
5:12: His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.
5:13: His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.
5:14: His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.
5:15: His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
5:16: His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely.  This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
6:1: Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women?  whither is thy beloved turned aside?  that we may seek him with thee.
6:2: My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
6:3: I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.
6:4: Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.
6:5: Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.
6:6: Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.
6:7: As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks. 
6:8: There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.
6:9: My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her.  The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
