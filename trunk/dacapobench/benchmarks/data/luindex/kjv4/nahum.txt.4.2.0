1:12: Thus saith the LORD: Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through.  Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.
1:13: For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.

2:4: The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.
2:5: He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make hast to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.
2:6: The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.
2:7: And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.
