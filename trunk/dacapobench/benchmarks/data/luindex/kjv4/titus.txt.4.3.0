TITUS
1:1: Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;
1:2: In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
1:3: But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
1:4: To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
1:5: For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:
1:6: If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
1:7: For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
1:8: But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
1:9: Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
1:10: For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
1:11: Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.
1:12: One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.
1:13: This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
1:14: Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
1:15: Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
1:16: They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
2:1: But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
2:2: That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.
2:3: The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;
2:4: That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,
2:5: To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
2:6: Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
2:7: In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
2:8: Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.
2:9: Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;
2:10: Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
2:11: For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
2:12: Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;
2:13: Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
2:14: Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
2:15: These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
3:1: Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,
3:2: To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.
3:3: For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
3:4: But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,
