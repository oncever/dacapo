  5:6: For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
  5:7: Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
  5:8: This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.
  5:9: A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
  5:10: I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
  5:11: And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.
  5:12: I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
  5:13: For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
  5:14: For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
  5:15: But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
  5:16: This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
  5:17: For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
  5:18: But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
  5:19: Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
  5:20: Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
  5:21: Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
  5:22: But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
  5:23: Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
  5:24: And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
  5:25: If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
  5:26: Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
  6:1: Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
  6:2: Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
  6:3: For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
  6:4: But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
  6:5: For every man shall bear his own burden.
  6:6: Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
  6:7: Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
  6:8: For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
  6:9: And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
  6:10: As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.
  6:11: Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.
  6:12: As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
  6:13: For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
  6:14: But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
  6:15: For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
  6:16: And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
