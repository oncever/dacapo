  12:9: Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
  12:10: Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
  12:11: Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
  12:12: Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
  12:13: Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
  12:14: Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
  12:15: Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
  12:16: Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.
  12:17: Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.
  12:18: If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.
  12:19: Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.
  12:20: Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.
  12:21: Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
  13:1: Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
  13:2: Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.
  13:3: For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:
  13:4: For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.
  13:5: Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.
  13:6: For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.
  13:7: Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
  13:8: Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
  13:9: For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
  13:10: Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
  13:11: And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.
  13:12: The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
  13:13: Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.
  13:14: But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.
  14:1: Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.
  14:2: For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.
  14:3: Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.
  14:4: Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.
  14:5: One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
  14:6: He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
  14:7: For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
  14:8: For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.
  14:9: For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.
  14:10: But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
  14:11: For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
  14:12: So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
  14:13: Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.
  14:14: I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
  14:15: But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.
  14:16: Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
  14:17: For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
  14:18: For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.
  14:19: Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.
  14:20: For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.
  14:21: It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.
  14:22: Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
  14:23: And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
  15:1: We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
  15:2: Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.
  15:3: For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.
  15:4: For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
  15:5: Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:
  15:6: That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
  15:7: Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.
  15:8: Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:
  15:9: And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.
  15:10: And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
  15:11: And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.
  15:12: And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.
  15:13: Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.
  15:14: And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
  15:15: Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,
  15:16: That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
  15:17: I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.
  15:18: For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,
  15:19: Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
  15:20: Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:
  15:21: But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.
  15:22: For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.
  15:23: But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;
  15:24: Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.
  15:25: But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
  15:26: For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.
  15:27: It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.
  15:28: When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.
  15:29: And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
  15:30: Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;
  15:31: That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;
  15:32: That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.
  15:33: Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
  16:1: I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:
  16:2: That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.
  16:3: Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:
  16:4: Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.
  16:5: Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my wellbeloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.
  16:6: Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.
  16:7: Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.
  16:8: Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.
  16:9: Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
  16:10: Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household.
  16:11: Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.
  16:12: Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.
  16:13: Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
  16:14: Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.
  16:15: Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.
  16:16: Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.
  16:17: Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.
  16:18: For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.
  16:19: For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.
  16:20: And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
  16:21: Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.
  16:22: I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.
  16:23: Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.
  16:24: The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
  16:25: Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,
