5:21: And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.
5:22: And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,
5:23: And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.
5:24: And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.
5:25: And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,
5:26: And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
5:27: When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.
5:28: For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.
5:29: And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.
5:30: And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?
5:31: And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
5:32: And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
5:33: But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
5:34: And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
5:35: While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?
5:36: As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.
5:37: And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
5:38: And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.
5:39: And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.
5:40: And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.
5:41: And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.
5:42: And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.
5:43: And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
6:1: And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
6:2: And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?
6:3: Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.
6:4: But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.
6:5: And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.
6:6: And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.
6:7: And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;
6:8: And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:
6:9: But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.
6:10: And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.
6:11: And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
6:12: And they went out, and preached that men should repent.
6:13: And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.
6:14: And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.
6:15: Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.
6:16: But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.
6:17: For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.
6:18: For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.
6:19: Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:
6:20: For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.
6:21: And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;
6:22: And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.
6:23: And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.
6:24: And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
6:25: And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.
6:26: And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.
6:27: And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
6:28: And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.
6:29: And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
6:30: And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.
6:31: And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
6:32: And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
6:33: And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.
6:34: And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
6:35: And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:
6:36: Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.
6:37: He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?
6:38: He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.
6:39: And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.
6:40: And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
6:41: And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.
6:42: And they did all eat, and were filled.
6:43: And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.
6:44: And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
6:45: And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.
6:46: And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.
6:47: And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.
6:48: And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.
6:49: But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:
6:50: For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.
6:51: And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.
6:52: For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.
6:53: And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.
6:54: And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,
6:55: And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
6:56: And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.
7:1: Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.
7:2: And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.
7:3: For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
7:4: And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.
7:5: Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?
7:6: He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
7:7: Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
7:8: For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.
7:9: And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.
7:10: For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:
7:11: But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.
7:12: And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
7:13: Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.
7:14: And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:
7:15: There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.
7:16: If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
7:17: And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
7:18: And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;
7:19: Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?
7:20: And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.
7:21: For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
7:22: Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
7:23: All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
7:24: And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.
7:25: For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:
7:26: The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.
7:27: But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.
7:28: And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.
7:29: And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.
7:30: And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.
7:31: And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
7:32: And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.
7:33: And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;
7:34: And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
7:35: And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
7:36: And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;
7:37: And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
8:1: In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,
8:2: I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:
8:3: And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.
8:4: And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?
8:5: And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
8:6: And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.
8:7: And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.
8:8: So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.
8:9: And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
8:10: And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
8:11: And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
8:12: And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.
8:13: And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.
8:14: Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.
8:15: And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.
8:16: And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.
8:17: And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?
8:18: Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?
8:19: When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.
8:20: And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.
8:21: And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?
8:22: And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.
8:23: And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.
8:24: And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.
8:25: After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.
8:26: And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.
8:27: And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?
8:28: And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
8:29: And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.
8:30: And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
8:31: And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
8:32: And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
8:33: But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.
8:34: And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
8:35: For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.
8:36: For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
8:37: Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
8:38: Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
9:1: And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.
9:2: And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.
9:3: And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.
9:4: And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
9:5: And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
9:6: For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
9:7: And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
9:8: And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
9:9: And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.
9:10: And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.
9:11: And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?
9:12: And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.
9:13: But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.
9:14: And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.
9:15: And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.
9:16: And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?
9:17: And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;
9:18: And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.
9:19: He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.
9:20: And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.
9:21: And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.
9:22: And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.
9:23: Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.
9:24: And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.
9:25: When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.
9:26: And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.
9:27: But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.
9:28: And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?
9:29: And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
9:30: And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.
9:31: For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.
9:32: But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.
9:33: And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?
9:34: But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.
9:35: And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.
9:36: And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,
9:37: Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.
9:38: And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.
9:39: But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.
9:40: For he that is not against us is on our part.
9:41: For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.
9:42: And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
9:43: And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
9:44: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
9:45: And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
9:46: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
9:47: And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:
9:48: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
9:49: For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
9:50: Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.
10:1: And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.
10:2: And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.
10:3: And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
10:4: And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.
10:5: And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.
10:6: But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.
10:7: For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;
10:8: And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.
10:9: What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
10:10: And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.
10:11: And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.
10:12: And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.
10:13: And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.
10:14: But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
10:15: Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.
10:16: And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.
10:17: And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
10:18: And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.
10:19: Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.
10:20: And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.
10:21: Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.
10:22: And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.
10:23: And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
10:24: And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
10:25: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
10:26: And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?
10:27: And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.
10:28: Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.
10:29: And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,
10:30: But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.
10:31: But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.
10:32: And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,
10:33: Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:
10:34: And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.
10:35: And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.
10:36: And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?
10:37: They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.
10:38: But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
10:39: And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:
10:40: But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.
10:41: And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.
10:42: But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.
10:43: But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:
10:44: And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.
10:45: For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
10:46: And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.
10:47: And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.
10:48: And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.
10:49: And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.
10:50: And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
10:51: And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.
10:52: And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.
11:1: And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,
11:2: And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.
11:3: And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.
11:4: And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.
11:5: And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
11:6: And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.
11:7: And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.
11:8: And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.
11:9: And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:
11:10: Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.
11:11: And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.
11:12: And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:
11:13: And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.
11:14: And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.
11:15: And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;
11:16: And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.
11:17: And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.
11:18: And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.
11:19: And when even was come, he went out of the city.
11:20: And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.
11:21: And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.
11:22: And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.
11:23: For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.
11:24: Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
11:25: And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
11:26: But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.
11:27: And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,
11:28: And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?
11:29: And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
11:30: The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.
11:31: And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
11:32: But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.
11:33: And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
12:1: And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.
12:2: And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.
12:3: And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.
12:4: And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.
12:5: And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.
12:6: Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.
12:7: But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.
12:8: And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.
12:9: What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.
12:10: And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:
12:11: This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
12:12: And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.
12:13: And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.
12:14: And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
12:15: Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.
12:16: And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.
12:17: And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.
12:18: Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
12:19: Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
12:20: Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
12:21: And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.
12:22: And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.
12:23: In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
12:24: And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?
12:25: For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.
12:26: And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
12:27: He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.
12:28: And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?
12:29: And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:
12:30: And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.
12:31: And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.
12:32: And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:
12:33: And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
12:34: And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.
12:35: And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?
12:36: For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
12:37: David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
12:38: And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,
12:39: And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:
12:40: Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.
12:41: And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.
12:42: And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
12:43: And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:
12:44: For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.
13:1: And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!
13:2: And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
13:3: And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
13:4: Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?
13:5: And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:
13:6: For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
13:7: And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.
