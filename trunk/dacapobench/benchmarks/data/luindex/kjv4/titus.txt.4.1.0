TITUS
1:1: Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;
1:2: In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
1:3: But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
1:4: To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
1:5: For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:
1:6: If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
1:7: For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
1:8: But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
1:9: Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
1:10: For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
1:11: Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.
