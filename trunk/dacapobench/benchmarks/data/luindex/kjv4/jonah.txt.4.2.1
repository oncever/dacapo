1:12: And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.
1:13: Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.
1:14: Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee.
1:15: So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.
1:16: Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.
1:17: Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.  And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
2:1: Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,
2:2: And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.
2:3: For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.
2:4: Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.
2:5: The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.
2:6: I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.
2:7: When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.
2:8: They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
2:9: But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed.  Salvation is of the LORD. 
2:10: And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
3:1: And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying, 
3:2: Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.
3:3: So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD.  Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.
3:4: And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
3:5: So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
3:6: For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
3:7: And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:
3:8: But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.
