2:17: The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.
2:18: Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.
2:19: Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.
2:20: Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this.  Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long?  shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
2:21: The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied.
2:22: Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.
3:1: I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
3:2: He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.
3:3: Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day.
3:4: My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.
3:5: He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.
3:6: He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.
3:7: He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy. 
3:8: Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.
3:9: He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked. 
3:10: He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places. 
3:11: He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.
3:12: He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
3:13: He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
3:14: I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.
3:15: He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.
3:16: He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.
3:17: And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.
3:18: And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:
3:19: Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
3:20: My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
3:21: This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.
3:22: It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
3:23: They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.
3:24: The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
3:25: The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.
3:26: It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.
3:27: It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
3:28: He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.
3:29: He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.
3:30: He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach. 
3:31: For the Lord will not cast off for ever:
3:32: But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies. 
3:33: For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. 
3:34: To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,
3:35: To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,
3:36: To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.
3:37: Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?
3:38: Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?
3:39: Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?
3:40: Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.
3:41: Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.
3:42: We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.
3:43: Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
3:44: Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.
3:45: Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.
3:46: All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
3:47: Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.
3:48: Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
3:49: Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
3:50: Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven. 
3:51: Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. 
3:52: Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.
3:53: They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.
3:54: Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.
3:55: I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.
3:56: Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
3:57: Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.
3:58: O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.
3:59: O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.
3:60: Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.
3:61: Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me;
3:62: The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
3:63: Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick.
3:64: Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.
3:65: Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.
3:66: Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.
4:1: How is the gold become dim!  how is the most fine gold changed!  the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.
4:2: The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!
4:3: Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
4:4: The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them. 
4:5: They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
4:6: For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.
