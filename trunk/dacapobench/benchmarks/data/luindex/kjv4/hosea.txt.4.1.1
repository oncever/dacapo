4:10: For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.
4:11: Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.
4:12: My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.
4:13: They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.
4:14: I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.
4:15: Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.
4:16: For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.
4:17: Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.
4:18: Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.
4:19: The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
5:1: Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.
5:2: And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all. 
5:3: I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled. 
5:4: They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.
5:5: And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.
5:6: They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them.
5:7: They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.
5:8: Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin.
5:9: Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.
5:10: The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
5:11: Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.
5:12: Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
5:13: When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.
5:14: For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him.
5:15: I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.
6:1: Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.
6:2: After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.
6:3: Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.
6:4: O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee?  O Judah, what shall I do unto thee?  for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.
6:5: Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.
6:6: For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
6:7: But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me. 
6:8: Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.
6:9: And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness. 
6:10: I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled. 
6:11: Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.
7:1: When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.
7:2: And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.
7:3: They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.
7:4: They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneeded the dough, until it be leavened.
7:5: In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.
7:6: For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.
7:7: They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.
7:8: Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
7:9: Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.
7:10: And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.
7:11: Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.
7:12: When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.
7:13: Woe unto them!  for they have fled from me: destruction unto them!  because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.
