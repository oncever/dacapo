24:13: My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste:

24:15: Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place: 
24:16: For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief. 
24:17: Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:
24:18: Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.

24:20: For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.

24:22: For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?
24:23: These things also belong to the wise.  It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.

24:32: Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.
24:33: Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
24:34: So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.
25:1: These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. 
25:2: It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.
25:3: The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable. 
25:4: Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.

25:18: A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
25:19: Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
25:20: As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.
25:21: If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:

31:19: She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.
31:20: She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
31:21: She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.
