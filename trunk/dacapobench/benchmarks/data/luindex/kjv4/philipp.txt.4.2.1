1:26: That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.
1:27: Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
1:28: And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.
1:29: For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;
1:30: Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
2:1: If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
2:2: Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.
2:3: Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
2:4: Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
2:5: Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
2:6: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
2:7: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
2:8: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
2:9: Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
2:10: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;
2:11: And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
2:12: Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
2:13: For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
2:14: Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
2:15: That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;
2:16: Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.
2:17: Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.
2:18: For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
2:19: But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
2:20: For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.
2:21: For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.
2:22: But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.
2:23: Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
2:24: But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
2:25: Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.
2:26: For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.
2:27: For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
2:28: I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
2:29: Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
2:30: Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
3:1: Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.
3:2: Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
3:3: For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.
3:4: Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:
3:5: Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
3:6: Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.
3:7: But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
3:8: Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,
3:9: And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:
3:10: That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;
3:11: If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
3:12: Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
3:13: Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
3:14: I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
3:15: Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.
3:16: Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
3:17: Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.
