22:16: Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:
22:17: Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?
22:18: Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
22:19: The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.
22:20: Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.
22:21: Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.
22:22: Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. 
22:23: If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.
22:24: Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. 
22:25: Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver. 
22:26: For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.
22:27: Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.
22:28: Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
22:29: When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.
22:30: He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
23:1: Then Job answered and said,
23:2: Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
23:3: Oh that I knew where I might find him!  that I might come even to his seat!
23:4: I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
23:5: I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.
23:6: Will he plead against me with his great power?  No; but he would put strength in me.
23:7: There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
23:8: Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:
23:9: On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:
23:10: But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
23:11: My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.
23:12: Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
23:13: But he is in one mind, and who can turn him?  and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
23:14: For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him. 
23:15: Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.
23:16: For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: 
23:17: Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face. 
24:1: Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?
24:2: Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.
24:3: They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
24:4: They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
24:5: Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.
24:6: They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
24:7: They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.
24:8: They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
24:9: They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.
24:10: They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;
24:11: Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.
24:12: Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.
24:13: They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.
24:14: The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.
24:15: The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.
24:16: In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.
24:17: For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.
24:18: He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
24:19: Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned. 
24:20: The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
24:21: He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow. 
24:22: He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life. 
24:23: Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.
24:24: They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.
24:25: And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?
25:1: Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
25:2: Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places.
25:3: Is there any number of his armies?  and upon whom doth not his light arise?
25:4: How then can man be justified with God?  or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?
25:5: Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.
25:6: How much less man, that is a worm?  and the son of man, which is a worm?
26:1: But Job answered and said,
26:2: How hast thou helped him that is without power?  how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
26:3: How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom?  and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
26:4: To whom hast thou uttered words?  and whose spirit came from thee?
26:5: Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
26:6: Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.
26:7: He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.
26:8: He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
26:9: He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it. 
26:10: He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.
26:11: The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. 
26:12: He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. 
26:13: By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
26:14: Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him?  but the thunder of his power who can understand?
27:1: Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
27:2: As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;
27:3: All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;
27:4: My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
27:5: God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.
27:6: My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
27:7: Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.
27:8: For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?
27:9: Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?
27:10: Will he delight himself in the Almighty?  will he always call upon God?
27:11: I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
27:12: Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?
27:13: This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.
27:14: If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
27:15: Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.
27:16: Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;
27:17: He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver. 
27:18: He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.
27:19: The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not. 
27:20: Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night. 
27:21: The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.
27:22: For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.
27:23: Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
28:1: Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.
28:2: Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.
28:3: He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.
28:4: The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.
28:5: As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.
28:6: The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.
28:7: There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:
28:8: The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
28:9: He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.
28:10: He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.
28:11: He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.
28:12: But where shall wisdom be found?  and where is the place of understanding?
28:13: Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.
28:14: The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.
28:15: It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.
28:16: It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. 
28:17: The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.
28:18: No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies. 
28:19: The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold. 
28:20: Whence then cometh wisdom?  and where is the place of understanding?
28:21: Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.
28:22: Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.
28:23: God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.
28:24: For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;
28:25: To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.
28:26: When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:
28:27: Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
28:28: And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
29:1: Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
29:2: Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me; 
29:3: When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness; 
29:4: As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;
29:5: When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;
29:6: When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
29:7: When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!
29:8: The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.
29:9: The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.
29:10: The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
29:11: When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:
29:12: Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.
29:13: The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
29:14: I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.
29:15: I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.
29:16: I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.
29:17: And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.
29:18: Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.
29:19: My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.
29:20: My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
29:21: Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.
29:22: After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
29:23: And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. 
29:24: If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.
29:25: I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners. 
30:1: But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.
30:2: Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?
30:3: For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
30:4: Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.
30:5: They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)
30:6: To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.
30:7: Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.
30:8: They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.
30:9: And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.
30:10: They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
30:11: Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.
30:12: Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
30:13: They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
30:14: They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.
30:15: Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
30:16: And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
30:17: My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
30:18: By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
30:19: He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.
30:20: I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not. 
30:21: Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
30:22: Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance. 
30:23: For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living. 
30:24: Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.
30:25: Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?  was not my soul grieved for the poor?
30:26: When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
30:27: My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.
30:28: I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.
30:29: I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
30:30: My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
30:31: My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
31:1: I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
31:2: For what portion of God is there from above?  and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
31:3: Is not destruction to the wicked?  and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?
31:4: Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?
31:5: If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
31:6: Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.
31:7: If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;
31:8: Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
31:9: If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;
31:10: Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.
31:11: For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges. 
31:12: For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.
31:13: If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me; 
31:14: What then shall I do when God riseth up?  and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? 
31:15: Did not he that made me in the womb make him?  and did not one fashion us in the womb?
31:16: If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
31:17: Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
31:18: (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
31:19: If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;
31:20: If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
31:21: If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:
31:22: Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.
31:23: For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
31:24: If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;
31:25: If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;
31:26: If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;
31:27: And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
31:28: This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.
31:29: If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:
31:30: Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
31:31: If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh!  we cannot be satisfied.
31:32: The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller.
31:33: If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:
31:34: Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door? 
31:35: Oh that one would hear me!  behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.
31:36: Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me. 
31:37: I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him. 
31:38: If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
31:39: If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
31:40: Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley.  The words of Job are ended.
32:1: So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
32:2: Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
32:3: Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
32:4: Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
32:5: When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
32:6: And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.
32:7: I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
32:8: But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
32:9: Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
32:10: Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
32:11: Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.
32:12: Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:
32:13: Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.
32:14: Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.
32:15: They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
32:16: When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;) 
32:17: I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.
32:18: For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. 
32:19: Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles. 
32:20: I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.
32:21: Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.
32:22: For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.
33:1: Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
33:2: Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
33:3: My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
33:4: The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
33:5: If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.
33:6: Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay. 
33:7: Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
33:8: Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying, 
33:9: I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me. 
33:10: Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,
33:11: He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.
33:12: Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
33:13: Why dost thou strive against him?  for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
33:14: For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
33:15: In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
33:16: Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,
33:17: That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
33:18: He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
33:19: He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:
33:20: So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.
33:21: His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.
33:22: Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
