17:3: And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.
17:4: And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.
17:5: And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.
17:6: And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. 
17:7: And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.
17:8: And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds. 
17:9: And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod. 
17:10: And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.
17:11: And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.
17:12: And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.
17:13: Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?
18:1: And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
18:2: And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.
18:3: And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.
18:4: And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.
18:5: And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.
18:6: And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
18:7: Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office for every thing of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
18:8: And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.
18:9: This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.
18:10: In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee.
18:11: And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
18:12: All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them have I given thee.
18:13: And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it.
18:14: Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.
18:15: Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem. 
18:16: And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.
18:17: But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
18:18: And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine. 
18:19: All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.
18:20: And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.
18:21: And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
18:22: Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.
18:23: But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.
18:24: But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
18:25: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
18:26: Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.
18:27: And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress.
18:28: Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest.
18:29: Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.
18:30: Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.
18:31: And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.
18:32: And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.
19:1: And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
19:2: This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:
19:3: And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:
19:4: And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:
19:5: And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn: 
19:6: And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
19:7: Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even. 
19:8: And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even. 
19:9: And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.
19:10: And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.
19:11: He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.
19:12: He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.
19:13: Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.
19:14: This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
19:15: And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.
19:16: And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
19:17: And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:
19:18: And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:
19:19: And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.
19:20: But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.
19:21: And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.
19:22: And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.
20:1: Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.
20:2: And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
20:3: And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!
20:4: And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there? 
20:5: And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place?  it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.
20:6: And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them. 
20:7: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
20:8: Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.
20:9: And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.
20:10: And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?
20:11: And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.
20:12: And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.
20:13: This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.
20:14: And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:
20:15: How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:
20:16: And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:
20:17: Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's highway, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.
20:18: And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.
20:19: And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing any thing else, go through on my feet.
20:20: And he said, Thou shalt not go through.  And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
20:21: Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.
20:22: And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.
20:23: And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,
20:24: Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.
20:25: Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor:
20:26: And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.
20:27: And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. 
20:28: And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.
20:29: And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel. 
21:1: And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.
21:2: And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.
21:3: And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.
21:4: And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
21:5: And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?  for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.
21:6: And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
21:7: Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us.  And Moses prayed for the people.
21:8: And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.
21:9: And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
21:10: And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.
21:11: And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.
21:12: From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
21:13: From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
21:14: Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,
21:15: And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.
21:16: And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.
21:17: Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:
21:18: The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves.  And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:
21:19: And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
21:20: And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon. 
21:21: And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
21:22: Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders. 
21:23: And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 
21:24: And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
21:25: And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.
21:26: For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.
21:27: Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:
21:28: For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.
21:29: Woe to thee, Moab!  thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.
21:30: We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.
21:31: Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
21:32: And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.
21:33: And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.
21:34: And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
21:35: So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.
22:1: And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.
22:2: And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
22:3: And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
22:4: And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field.  And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.
22:5: He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:
22:6: Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.
22:7: And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak. 
22:8: And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
22:9: And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee? 
22:10: And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying, 
22:11: Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.
22:12: And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.
22:13: And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.
22:14: And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.
22:15: And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.
22:16: And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:
22:17: For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people. 
22:18: And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.
22:19: Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more. 
22:20: And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do. 
22:21: And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
22:22: And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him.  Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.
22:23: And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.
22:24: But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
22:25: And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.
22:26: And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
22:27: And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.
22:28: And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?
22:29: And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.
22:30: And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day?  was I ever wont to do so unto thee?  And he said, Nay.
22:31: Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.
22:32: And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times?  behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:
22:33: And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.
22:34: And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.
22:35: And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak.  So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
22:36: And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast.
22:37: And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee?  wherefore camest thou not unto me?  am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?
22:38: And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing?  the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.
22:39: And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth.
22:40: And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him. 
22:41: And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.
23:1: And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams. 
23:2: And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.
23:3: And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee.  And he went to an high place.
23:4: And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.
23:5: And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.
23:6: And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.
23:7: And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.
23:8: How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed?  or how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?
23:9: For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
23:10: Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel?  Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!
23:11: And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me?  I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.
23:12: And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?
23:13: And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.
23:14: And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
23:15: And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet the LORD yonder.
23:16: And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.
23:17: And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him.  And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?
23:18: And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:
23:19: God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it?  or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
23:20: Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.
23:21: He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them. 
23:22: God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.
23:23: Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought! 
23:24: Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain. 
23:25: And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
23:26: But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?
23:27: And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.
23:28: And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon.
23:29: And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
23:30: And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
24:1: And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
24:2: And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.
24:3: And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:
24:4: He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
24:5: How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!
24:6: As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.
24:7: He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
24:8: God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.
24:9: He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up?  Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.
24:10: And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.
24:11: Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.
24:12: And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,
24:13: If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak? 
24:14: And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.
24:15: And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 
24:16: He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: 
24:17: I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.
24:18: And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.
24:19: Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.
24:20: And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.
24:21: And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.
24:22: Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.
24:23: And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!
24:24: And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.
24:25: And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.
25:1: And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.
25:2: And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods. 
25:3: And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.
25:4: And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel. 
25:5: And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal-peor. 
25:6: And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
25:7: And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;
25:8: And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly.  So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
25:9: And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.
25:10: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
25:11: Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.
25:12: Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:
25:13: And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.
25:14: Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.
25:15: And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.
25:16: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
25:17: Vex the Midianites, and smite them:
25:18: For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.
26:1: And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
26:2: Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their father's house, all that are able to go to war in Israel.
26:3: And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,
