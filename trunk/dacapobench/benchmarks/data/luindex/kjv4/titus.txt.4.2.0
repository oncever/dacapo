TITUS
1:1: Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;
1:2: In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
1:3: But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
1:4: To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
1:5: For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:
1:6: If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
1:7: For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;

1:9: Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.

1:15: Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
1:16: They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
2:1: But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
2:2: That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.
2:3: The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;
2:4: That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,
2:5: To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
2:6: Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
2:7: In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
