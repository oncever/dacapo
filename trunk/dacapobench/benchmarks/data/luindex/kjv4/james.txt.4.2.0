JAMES
 1:1: James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
 1:2: My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
 1:3: Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
 1:4: But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
 1:5: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
 1:6: But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
 1:7: For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
 1:8: A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.
 1:9: Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
 1:10: But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
 1:11: For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
 1:12: Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
 1:13: Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:
 1:14: But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.
 1:15: Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
 1:16: Do not err, my beloved brethren.
 1:17: Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
 1:18: Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
 1:19: Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
 1:20: For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
 1:21: Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
 1:22: But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
 1:23: For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
 1:24: For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
 1:25: But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
 1:26: If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.
 1:27: Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.
 2:1: My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.
 2:2: For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
 2:3: And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
 2:4: Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
 2:5: Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
 2:6: But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?
 2:7: Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
 2:8: If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:
 2:9: But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.
 2:10: For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.
 2:11: For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
 2:12: So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
 2:13: For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
 2:14: What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?
 2:15: If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
 2:16: And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?
 2:17: Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
 2:18: Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.
 2:19: Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.
 2:20: But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
 2:21: Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
 2:22: Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
 2:23: And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
 2:24: Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
 2:25: Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?
 2:26: For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
