3:7: Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head:
3:8: And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the LORD hath spoken it.
3:9: Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:
3:10: Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.

3:19: Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
