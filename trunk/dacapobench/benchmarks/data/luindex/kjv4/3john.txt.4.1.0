THIRD JOHN
 1:1: The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
 1:2: Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
 1:3: For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.
