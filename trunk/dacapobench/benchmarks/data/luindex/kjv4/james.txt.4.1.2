 3:1: My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
 3:2: For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.
 3:3: Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.
 3:4: Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.
 3:5: Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
 3:6: And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.
 3:7: For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:
 3:8: But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
 3:9: Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.
 3:10: Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
 3:11: Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?
 3:12: Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.
 3:13: Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
 3:14: But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.
 3:15: This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
 3:16: For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.
 3:17: But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
 3:18: And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
 4:1: From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?
 4:2: Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.
 4:3: Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.
 4:4: Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
 4:5: Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?
 4:6: But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
 4:7: Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
 4:8: Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.
 4:9: Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.
