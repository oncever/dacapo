5:21: And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.
5:22: And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,
5:23: And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.
5:24: And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.
5:25: And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,
5:26: And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
5:27: When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.
5:28: For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.
5:29: And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.
5:30: And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?
5:31: And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
5:32: And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
5:33: But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
5:34: And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
5:35: While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?
5:36: As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.
5:37: And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
5:38: And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.
5:39: And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.
5:40: And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.
5:41: And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.
5:42: And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.
5:43: And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
6:1: And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
6:2: And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?
6:3: Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.
6:4: But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.
6:5: And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.
6:6: And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.
6:7: And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;
6:8: And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:
6:9: But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.
6:10: And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.
6:11: And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
6:12: And they went out, and preached that men should repent.
6:13: And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.
6:14: And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.
6:15: Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.
6:16: But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.
6:17: For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.
6:18: For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.
6:19: Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:
6:20: For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.
6:21: And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;
6:22: And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.
6:23: And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.
6:24: And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
6:25: And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.
6:26: And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.
6:27: And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
6:28: And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.
6:29: And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
6:30: And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.
6:31: And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
6:32: And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
6:33: And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.
6:34: And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
6:35: And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:
6:36: Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.
6:37: He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?
6:38: He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.
6:39: And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.
6:40: And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
6:41: And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.
6:42: And they did all eat, and were filled.
6:43: And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.
6:44: And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
6:45: And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.
6:46: And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.
6:47: And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.
6:48: And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.
6:49: But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:
6:50: For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.
6:51: And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.
6:52: For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.
6:53: And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.
6:54: And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,
6:55: And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
6:56: And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.
7:1: Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.
7:2: And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.
7:3: For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
7:4: And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.
7:5: Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?
7:6: He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
7:7: Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
7:8: For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.
7:9: And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.
7:10: For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:
7:11: But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.
7:12: And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
7:13: Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.
7:14: And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:
7:15: There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.
7:16: If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
7:17: And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
7:18: And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;
7:19: Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?
7:20: And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.
7:21: For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
7:22: Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
7:23: All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
7:24: And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.
7:25: For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:
7:26: The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.
7:27: But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.
7:28: And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.
7:29: And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.
7:30: And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.
7:31: And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
7:32: And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.
7:33: And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;
7:34: And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
7:35: And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
7:36: And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;
7:37: And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
8:1: In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,
8:2: I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:
8:3: And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.
8:4: And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?
8:5: And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
8:6: And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.
8:7: And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.
8:8: So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.
8:9: And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
8:10: And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
8:11: And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
8:12: And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.
8:13: And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.
8:14: Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.
8:15: And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.
8:16: And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.
8:17: And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?
8:18: Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?
8:19: When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.
8:20: And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.
8:21: And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?
8:22: And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.
8:23: And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.
8:24: And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.
8:25: After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.
8:26: And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.
8:27: And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?
8:28: And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
8:29: And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.
8:30: And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
8:31: And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
8:32: And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
8:33: But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.
8:34: And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
8:35: For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.
8:36: For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
8:37: Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
8:38: Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
9:1: And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.
9:2: And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.
9:3: And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.
9:4: And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
9:5: And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
9:6: For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
9:7: And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
9:8: And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
9:9: And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.
9:10: And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.
9:11: And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?
9:12: And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.
9:13: But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.
9:14: And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.
9:15: And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.
9:16: And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?
