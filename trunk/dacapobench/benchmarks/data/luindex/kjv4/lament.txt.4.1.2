3:34: To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,
3:35: To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,
3:36: To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.
3:37: Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?

3:43: Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
3:44: Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.
3:45: Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.
3:46: All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
3:47: Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.
3:48: Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
3:49: Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
3:50: Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven. 
3:51: Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. 
3:52: Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.
3:53: They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.
3:54: Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.
3:55: I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.
3:56: Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
3:57: Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.
3:58: O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.

3:60: Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.
3:61: Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me;
3:62: The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
3:63: Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick.
3:64: Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.
3:65: Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.
3:66: Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.
4:1: How is the gold become dim!  how is the most fine gold changed!  the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.
4:2: The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!
4:3: Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
4:4: The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them. 
4:5: They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
4:6: For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.
