12:9: Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
12:10: In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.
12:11: Doth not the ear try words?  and the mouth taste his meat?
12:12: With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.
12:13: With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.
12:14: Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
12:15: Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
12:16: With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.
12:17: He leadeth counsellers away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.
12:18: He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.
12:19: He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty. 
12:20: He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.
12:21: He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty. 
12:22: He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death. 
12:23: He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.
12:24: He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
12:25: They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
13:1: Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.
13:2: What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.
13:3: Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.
13:4: But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.
13:5: O that ye would altogether hold your peace!  and it should be your wisdom.
13:6: Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
13:7: Will ye speak wickedly for God?  and talk deceitfully for him? 
13:8: Will ye accept his person?  will ye contend for God?
13:9: Is it good that he should search you out?  or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him? 
13:10: He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons. 
13:11: Shall not his excellency make you afraid?  and his dread fall upon you?
13:12: Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.
13:13: Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.
13:14: Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?
13:15: Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.
13:16: He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.
13:17: Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
13:18: Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.
13:19: Who is he that will plead with me?  for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.
13:20: Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.
13:21: Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.
13:22: Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.
13:23: How many are mine iniquities and sins?  make me to know my transgression and my sin.
13:24: Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?
13:25: Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro?  and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
13:26: For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.
13:27: Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.
13:28: And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.
14:1: Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. 
14:2: He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
14:3: And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee? 
14:4: Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?  not one. 
14:5: Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
14:6: Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.
14:7: For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
14:8: Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;
14:9: Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.
14:10: But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?
14:11: As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:
14:12: So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.
14:13: O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
14:14: If a man die, shall he live again?  all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.
14:15: Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.
14:16: For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?
14:17: My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.
14:18: And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.
14:19: The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.
14:20: Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
14:21: His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.
14:22: But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.
15:1: Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 
15:2: Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?
15:3: Should he reason with unprofitable talk?  or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? 
15:4: Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. 
15:5: For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
15:6: Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
15:7: Art thou the first man that was born?  or wast thou made before the hills?
15:8: Hast thou heard the secret of God?  and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
15:9: What knowest thou, that we know not?  what understandest thou, which is not in us?
15:10: With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.
15:11: Are the consolations of God small with thee?  is there any secret thing with thee?
15:12: Why doth thine heart carry thee away?  and what do thy eyes wink at,
15:13: That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?
15:14: What is man, that he should be clean?  and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
15:15: Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
15:16: How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?
15:17: I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;
15:18: Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:
15:19: Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.
15:20: The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.
15:21: A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
15:22: He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.
15:23: He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it?  he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
15:24: Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. 
15:25: For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.
15:26: He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers: 
15:27: Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks. 
15:28: And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.
15:29: He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.
15:30: He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
15:31: Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.
15:32: It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.
15:33: He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
15:34: For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.
15:35: They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.
16:1: Then Job answered and said,
16:2: I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.
16:3: Shall vain words have an end?  or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
16:4: I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.
16:5: But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.
16:6: Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?
16:7: But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.
16:8: And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.
16:9: He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
16:10: They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.
16:11: God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. 
16:12: I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.
16:13: His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground. 
16:14: He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant. 
16:15: I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.
16:16: My face is foul with weeping, and my eyelids is the shadow of death;
16:17: Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.
16:18: O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.
16:19: Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.
16:20: My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.
16:21: O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!
16:22: When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
17:1: My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.
17:2: Are there not mockers with me?  and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?
17:3: Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?
17:4: For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.
17:5: He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.
17:6: He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.
17:7: Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.
17:8: Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
17:9: The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
17:10: But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.
17:11: My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart. 
17:12: They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.
17:13: If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness. 
17:14: I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou are my mother, and my sister. 
17:15: And where is now my hope?  as for my hope, who shall see it?
17:16: They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.
18:1: Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
18:2: How long will it be ere ye make an end of words?  mark, and afterwards we will speak.
18:3: Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?
18:4: He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee?  and shall the rock be removed out of his place?
18:5: Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
18:6: The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.
18:7: The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.
18:8: For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare. 
18:9: The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.
18:10: The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way. 
18:11: Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet. 
18:12: His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.
18:13: It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.
18:14: His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.
18:15: It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
18:16: His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.
18:17: His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.
18:18: He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.
18:19: He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.
18:20: They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.
18:21: Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
19:1: Then Job answered and said,
19:2: How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?
19:3: These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.
19:4: And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.
19:5: If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:
19:6: Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.
19:7: Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.
19:8: He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.
19:9: He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. 
19:10: He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.
19:11: He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies. 
19:12: His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle. 
19:13: He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.
19:14: My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
19:15: They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.
19:16: I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.
19:17: My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.
19:18: Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.
19:19: All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.
19:20: My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
19:21: Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.
19:22: Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
19:23: Oh that my words were now written!  oh that they were printed in a book!
19:24: That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!
19:25: For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:
19:26: And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:
19:27: Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.
19:28: But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?
19:29: Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.
20:1: Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
20:2: Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste. 
20:3: I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.
20:4: Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth, 
20:5: That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment? 
20:6: Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;
20:7: Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?
20:8: He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
20:9: The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.
20:10: His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.
20:11: His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.
20:12: Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;
20:13: Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:
20:14: Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.
20:15: He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.
20:16: He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.
20:17: He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.
20:18: That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.
20:19: Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;
20:20: Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.
20:21: There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.
20:22: In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
20:23: When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.
20:24: He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.
20:25: It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him. 
20:26: All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.
20:27: The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him. 
20:28: The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath. 
20:29: This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
21:1: But Job answered and said,
21:2: Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.
21:3: Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.
21:4: As for me, is my complaint to man?  and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?
21:5: Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.
21:6: Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.
21:7: Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?
21:8: Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
21:9: Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.
21:10: Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
21:11: They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.
21:12: They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.
21:13: They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.
21:14: Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
21:15: What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?  and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
21:16: Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
21:17: How oft is the candle of the wicked put out!  and how oft cometh their destruction upon them!  God distributeth sorrows in his anger.
21:18: They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. 
21:19: God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.
21:20: His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 
21:21: For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? 
21:22: Shall any teach God knowledge?  seeing he judgeth those that are high.
21:23: One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
21:24: His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.
21:25: And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.
21:26: They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.
21:27: Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.
21:28: For ye say, Where is the house of the prince?  and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?
21:29: Have ye not asked them that go by the way?  and do ye not know their tokens,
21:30: That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction?  they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.
21:31: Who shall declare his way to his face?  and who shall repay him what he hath done?
21:32: Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.
21:33: The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.
21:34: How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
22:1: Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
22:2: Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?
22:3: Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous?  or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect?
22:4: Will he reprove thee for fear of thee?  will he enter with thee into judgment?
22:5: Is not thy wickedness great?  and thine iniquities infinite?
22:6: For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. 
22:7: Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
22:8: But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it. 
22:9: Thou has sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 
22:10: Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;
22:11: Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.
22:12: Is not God in the height of heaven?  and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
22:13: And thou sayest, How doth God know?  can he judge through the dark cloud?
22:14: Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.
22:15: Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
