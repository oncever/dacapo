4:7: But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.
4:8: For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
4:9: This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
4:10: For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.

4:12: Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
4:13: Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
4:14: Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
4:15: Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.

5:15: For some are already turned aside after Satan.
5:16: If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.
