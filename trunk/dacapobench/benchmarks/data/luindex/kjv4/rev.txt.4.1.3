 18:7: How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
 18:8: Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.
 18:9: And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,
 18:10: Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.
 18:11: And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:
 18:12: The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,
 18:13: And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.

 18:16: And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!

 18:18: And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!
 18:19: And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.

 21:11: Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
 21:12: And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
 21:13: On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
 21:14: And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

 21:19: And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;
 21:20: The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.
 21:21: And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.
 21:22: And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.
 21:23: And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.

 21:25: And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.
 21:26: And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.

 22:3: And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:
 22:4: And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.

 22:10: And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.
 22:11: He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
 22:12: And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.

 22:18: For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:
 22:19: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.
 22:20: He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
