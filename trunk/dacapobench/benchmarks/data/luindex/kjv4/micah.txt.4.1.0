1:5: For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel.  What is the transgression of Jacob?  is it not Samaria?  and what are the high places of Judah?  are they not Jerusalem?
1:6: Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.
1:7: And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.

1:13: O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee. 
1:14: Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.
1:15: Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.
1:16: Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.
2:1: Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds!  when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.
2:2: And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.
2:3: Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.
2:4: In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me!  turning away he hath divided our fields.
2:5: Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.
2:6: Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.
2:7: O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened?  are these his doings?  do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?
2:8: Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.
2:9: The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.
