21:15: And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.
21:16: There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.
21:17: And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
21:18: And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.
21:19: And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.
21:20: And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:
21:21: And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.
21:22: What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.
21:23: Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;
21:24: Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.
21:25: As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.
21:26: Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.
21:27: And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,
21:28: Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.
21:29: (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)
21:30: And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.
21:31: And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
21:32: Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.
21:33: Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.
21:34: And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.
21:35: And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.
21:36: For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.
21:37: And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?
21:38: Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?
21:39: But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.
21:40: And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,
22:1: Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you.
22:2: (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)
22:3: I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.
22:4: And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
22:5: As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.
22:6: And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
22:7: And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
22:8: And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
22:9: And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
22:10: And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.
22:11: And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.
22:12: And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,
22:13: Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.
22:14: And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.
22:15: For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
22:16: And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
22:17: And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;
22:18: And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
22:19: And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:
22:20: And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.
22:21: And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.
22:22: And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
22:23: And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,
22:24: The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.
22:25: And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
22:26: When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.
22:27: Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.
22:28: And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.
22:29: Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
22:30: On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.
23:1: And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.
23:2: And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
23:3: Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?
23:4: And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?
23:5: Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
23:6: But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
23:7: And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.
23:8: For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
23:9: And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
23:10: And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.
23:11: And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.
23:12: And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
23:13: And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
23:14: And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.
23:15: Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.
23:16: And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.
23:17: Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.
23:18: So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.
23:19: Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?
23:20: And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.
23:21: But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.
23:22: So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.
23:23: And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;
23:24: And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.
23:25: And he wrote a letter after this manner:
23:26: Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.
23:27: This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.
23:28: And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:
23:29: Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.
23:30: And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.
23:31: Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.
23:32: On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:
23:33: Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
23:34: And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;
23:35: I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.
24:1: And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.
24:2: And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,
24:3: We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
24:4: Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.
24:5: For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
24:6: Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.
24:7: But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,
24:8: Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.
24:9: And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
24:10: Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:
24:11: Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.
24:12: And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:
24:13: Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.
24:14: But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:
24:15: And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
24:16: And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men.
24:17: Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.
24:18: Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.
24:19: Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.
24:20: Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,
24:21: Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.
24:22: And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.
24:23: And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.
24:24: And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
24:25: And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.
24:26: He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.
24:27: But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
25:1: Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
25:2: Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,
25:3: And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.
25:4: But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.
25:5: Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.
25:6: And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.
25:7: And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.
25:8: While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.
25:9: But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?
25:10: Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.
25:11: For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.
25:12: Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.
25:13: And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.
25:14: And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:
25:15: About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.
25:16: To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.
25:17: Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
25:18: Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:
25:19: But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
25:20: And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.
25:21: But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.
25:22: Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.
25:23: And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.
25:24: And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.
25:25: But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.
25:26: Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.
25:27: For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.
26:1: Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:
26:2: I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:
26:3: Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
26:4: My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
26:5: Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
26:6: And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:
26:7: Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.
26:8: Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?
26:9: I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
26:10: Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.
26:11: And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.
26:12: Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
26:13: At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.
26:14: And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
26:15: And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
26:16: But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;
26:17: Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,
26:18: To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.
26:19: Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:
26:20: But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.
26:21: For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.
26:22: Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:
26:23: That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.
26:24: And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.
26:25: But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
26:26: For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.
26:27: King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.
26:28: Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.
26:29: And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
26:30: And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:
26:31: And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
26:32: Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
27:1: And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.
27:2: And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
27:3: And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.
27:4: And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
27:5: And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
27:6: And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.
27:7: And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;
27:8: And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.
27:9: Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,
27:10: And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.
27:11: Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.
27:12: And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.
27:13: And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.
27:14: But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.
27:15: And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.
27:16: And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:
27:17: Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.
27:18: And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;
27:19: And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.
27:20: And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.
27:21: But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.
27:22: And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.
27:23: For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
27:24: Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.
27:25: Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.
27:26: Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
27:27: But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;
27:28: And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.
27:29: Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.
27:30: And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,
27:31: Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
27:32: Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
27:33: And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.
27:34: Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.
27:35: And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.
27:36: Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.
27:37: And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
27:38: And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.
27:39: And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.
27:40: And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.
27:41: And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.
27:42: And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.
27:43: But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:
27:44: And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.
28:1: And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.
28:2: And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
28:3: And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
28:4: And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.
28:5: And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
28:6: Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
28:7: In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.
28:8: And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
28:9: So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:
28:10: Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.
28:11: And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
28:12: And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.
28:13: And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:
28:14: Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.
28:15: And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
28:16: And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.
28:17: And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
28:18: Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.
28:19: But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.
28:20: For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
28:21: And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.
28:22: But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.
28:23: And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.
28:24: And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
28:25: And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,
28:26: Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:
28:27: For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
28:28: Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.
28:29: And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.
28:30: And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,
28:31: Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.
