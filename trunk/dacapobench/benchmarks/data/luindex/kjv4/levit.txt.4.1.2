16:4: He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.

16:14: And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times. 
16:15: Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:
16:16: And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.

16:34: And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year.  And he did as the LORD commanded Moses. 
17:1: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
17:2: Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying, 
17:3: What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,
17:4: And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:
17:5: To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace offerings unto the LORD.
17:6: And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

17:9: And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.
17:10: And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.
17:11: For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.
17:12: Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.
17:13: And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.
17:14: For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.
17:15: And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.
17:16: But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.
18:1: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
18:2: Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God.
18:3: After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.
18:4: Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God. 
18:5: Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.
18:6: None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.

18:11: The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
18:12: Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman.
18:13: Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.
18:14: Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.

18:16: Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness.
18:17: Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.
18:18: Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.
18:19: Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.
18:20: Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her.
18:21: And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.
18:22: Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.
18:23: Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.

18:25: And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.
18:26: Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:
18:27: (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;) 
18:28: That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.
18:29: For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people. 
18:30: Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God. 
19:1: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
19:2: Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy.
19:3: Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.
19:4: Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.
19:5: And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will.
19:6: It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.
19:7: And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted.

19:14: Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.
19:15: Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.
19:16: Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the LORD.
19:17: Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.
19:18: Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.
19:19: Ye shall keep my statutes.  Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee. 
19:20: And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
19:21: And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering. 
19:22: And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him. 
19:23: And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.
19:24: But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal.
19:25: And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.
19:26: Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.
19:27: Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.
19:28: Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.
19:29: Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.
19:30: Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
19:31: Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.
19:32: Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.
19:33: And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.
19:34: But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
19:35: Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.
19:36: Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.

20:3: And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
20:4: And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not: 
20:5: Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.
20:6: And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. 
20:7: Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God. 
20:8: And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you.
20:9: For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.

21:20: Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;
21:21: No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.
21:22: He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.
21:23: Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.
21:24: And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.
22:1: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
22:2: Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD.
22:3: Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.
22:4: What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean.  And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;
22:5: Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;
22:6: The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.
22:7: And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.
22:8: That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I am the LORD.
22:9: They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.
22:10: There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.
22:11: But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.
22:12: If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.

22:14: And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing. 
22:15: And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;
22:16: Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them. 
22:17: And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
22:18: Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;
22:19: Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.
22:20: But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
