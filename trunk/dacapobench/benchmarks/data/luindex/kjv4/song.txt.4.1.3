6:10: Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners? 
6:11: I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded.
6:12: Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.
6:13: Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee.  What will ye see in the Shulamite?  As it were the company of two armies.
7:1: How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter!  the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.
7:2: Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.
7:3: Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.
7:4: Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.
7:5: Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries. 
7:6: How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!
7:7: This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes. 
7:8: I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples; 
7:9: And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.
7:10: I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.
7:11: Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.
7:12: Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.
7:13: The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
8:1: O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother!  when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.
8:2: I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
8:3: His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
8:4: I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.
8:5: Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?  I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.
8:6: Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.
8:7: Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.
8:8: We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
8:9: If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.
8:10: I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.
8:11: Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.
8:12: My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
