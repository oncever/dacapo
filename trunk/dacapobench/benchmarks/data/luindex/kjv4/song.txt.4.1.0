THE SONG OF SOLOMON
1:1: The song of songs, which is Solomon's.
1:2: Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.
1:3: Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.
1:4: Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.
1:5: I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
1:6: Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.
1:7: Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?
1:8: If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.
1:9: I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.
1:10: Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold.
1:11: We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.
1:12: While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.
1:13: A bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.
1:14: My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En-gedi.
1:15: Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes.
1:16: Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green.
1:17: The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.
2:1: I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.
2:2: As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. 
2:3: As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons.  I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.
2:4: He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love. 
2:5: Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love. 
2:6: His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.
2:7: I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.
2:8: The voice of my beloved!  behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.
2:9: My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.
2:10: My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
2:11: For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;
