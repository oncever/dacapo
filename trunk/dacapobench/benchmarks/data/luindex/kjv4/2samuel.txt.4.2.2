14:14: For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.
14:15: Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.
14:16: For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
14:17: Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.
14:18: Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee.  And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
14:19: And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this?  And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:
14:20: To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
14:21: And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.
14:22: And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.
14:23: So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
14:24: And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face.  So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.
14:25: But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
14:26: And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.
14:27: And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.
14:28: So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.
14:29: Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.
14:30: Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire.  And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
14:31: Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?
14:32: And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur?  it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me. 
14:33: So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.
15:1: And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him. 
15:2: And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou?  And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
15:3: And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.
15:4: Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!
15:5: And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
15:6: And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
15:7: And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.
15:8: For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.
15:9: And the king said unto him, Go in peace.  So he arose, and went to Hebron.
15:10: But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
15:11: And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.
15:12: And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counseller, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices.  And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
15:13: And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
15:14: And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
15:15: And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.
15:16: And the king went forth, and all his household after him.  And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.
15:17: And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.
15:18: And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
15:19: Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us?  return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.
15:20: Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us?  seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.
15:21: And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.
15:22: And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over.  And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.
15:23: And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
15:24: And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
15:25: And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation: 
15:26: But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.
15:27: The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?  return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. 
15:28: See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me. 
15:29: Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
15:30: And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
15:31: And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.  And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
15:32: And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:
15:33: Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:
15:34: But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
15:35: And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests?  therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
15:36: Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.
15:37: So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
16:1: And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
16:2: And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these?  And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.
16:3: And the king said, And where is thy master's son?  And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.
16:4: Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth.  And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.
16:5: And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.
16:6: And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
16:7: And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:
16:8: The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.
16:9: Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?  let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.
16:10: And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah?  so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David.  Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so? 
16:11: And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it?  let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.
16:12: It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day. 
16:13: And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. 
16:14: And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.
16:15: And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
16:16: And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.
16:17: And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend?  why wentest thou not with thy friend?
16:18: And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
16:19: And again, whom should I serve?  should I not serve in the presence of his son?  as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.
16:20: Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.
16:21: And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.
16:22: So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
16:23: And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
17:1: Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:
17:2: And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:
17:3: And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.
17:4: And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
17:5: Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.
17:6: And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying?  if not; speak thou.
17:7: And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.
17:8: For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
17:9: Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom. 
17:10: And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.
17:11: Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person. 
17:12: So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one. 
17:13: Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.
17:14: And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.  For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.
17:15: Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.
17:16: Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.
17:17: Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.
17:18: Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.
17:19: And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.
17:20: And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan?  And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water.  And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
17:21: And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.
17:22: Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.
17:23: And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.
17:24: Then David came to Mahanaim.  And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
17:25: And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.
17:26: So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.
17:27: And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
17:28: Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse,
17:29: And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.
18:1: And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
18:2: And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.  And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
18:3: But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city. 
18:4: And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do.  And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
18:5: And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.  And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom. 
18:6: So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim; 
18:7: Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.
18:8: For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
18:9: And Absalom met the servants of David.  And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.
18:10: And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.
18:11: And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground?  and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.
18:12: And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.
18:13: Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.
18:14: Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee.  And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
18:15: And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.
18:16: And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.
18:17: And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.
18:18: Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.
18:19: Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.
18:20: And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.
18:21: Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.  And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.
18:22: Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi.  And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?
18:23: But howsoever, said he, let me run.  And he said unto him, Run.  Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.
18:24: And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.
18:25: And the watchman cried, and told the king.  And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth.  And he came apace, and drew near.
18:26: And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone.  And the king said, He also bringeth tidings. 
18:27: And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.  And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.
18:28: And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well.  And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king. 
18:29: And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe?  And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was. 
18:30: And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here.  And he turned aside, and stood still.
18:31: And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.
18:32: And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe?  And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.
18:33: And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom!  would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!
19:1: And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.
19:2: And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.
19:3: And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
19:4: But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!
19:5: And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;
19:6: In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends.  For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.
19:7: Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.
19:8: Then the king arose, and sat in the gate.  And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate.  And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.
19:9: And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.
19:10: And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle.  Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?
19:11: And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house?  seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.
19:12: Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?
19:13: And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh?  God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.
19:14: And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.
19:15: So the king returned, and came to Jordan.  And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan. 
19:16: And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
19:17: And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king. 
19:18: And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good.  And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan; 
19:19: And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.
19:20: For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.
19:21: But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?
19:22: And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me?  shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel?  for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?
19:23: Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die.  And the king sware unto him.
19:24: And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.
19:25: And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?
19:26: And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.
19:27: And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.
19:28: For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table.  What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?
19:29: And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters?  I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.
19:30: And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.
19:31: And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.
19:32: Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.
19:33: And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.
19:34: And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?
19:35: I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil?  can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink?  can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women?  wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?
19:36: Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
19:37: Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother.  But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.
19:38: And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee. 
19:39: And all the people went over Jordan.  And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.
19:40: Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel. 
19:41: And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan? 
19:42: And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter?  have we eaten at all of the king's cost?  or hath he given us any gift?
19:43: And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?  And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
20:1: And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.
20:2: So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.
20:3: And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them.  So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.
20:4: Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.
20:5: So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
20:6: And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.
20:7: And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
20:8: When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them.  And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.
20:9: And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother?  And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.
20:10: But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died.  So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
20:11: And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.
20:12: And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway.  And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.
20:13: When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
20:14: And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.
20:15: And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
20:16: Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.
20:17: And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab?  And he answered, I am he.  Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid.  And he answered, I do hear. 
20:18: Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.
20:19: I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD? 
20:20: And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy. 
20:21: The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.  And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
20:22: Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom.  And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab.  And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent.  And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.
20:23: Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:
20:24: And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:
20:25: And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:
20:26: And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.
21:1: Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD.  And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.
21:2: And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)
21:3: Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?  and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?
21:4: And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel.  And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.
21:5: And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,
21:6: Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose.  And the king said, I will give them.
21:7: But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
21:8: But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
21:9: And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.
21:10: And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
21:11: And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
21:12: And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, which had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:
21:13: And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged. 
21:14: And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded.  And after that God was intreated for the land.
21:15: Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint. 
21:16: And Ishbi-benob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David. 
21:17: But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him.  Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel.
21:18: And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.
21:19: And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
21:20: And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
21:21: And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea the brother of David slew him.
21:22: These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
22:1: And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:
22:2: And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
22:3: The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.
22:4: I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
22:5: When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;
22:6: The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;
22:7: In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.
22:8: Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.
22:9: There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
22:10: He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet. 
22:11: And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
22:12: And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies. 
22:13: Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled. 
22:14: The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.
22:15: And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.
22:16: And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
22:17: He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
22:18: He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.
22:19: They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
22:20: He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
22:21: The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
22:22: For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
22:23: For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.
22:24: I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.
22:25: Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.
22:26: With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.
22:27: With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.
22:28: And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.
22:29: For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.
22:30: For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.
22:31: As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.
22:32: For who is God, save the LORD?  and who is a rock, save our God?
22:33: God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect. 
22:34: He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high places.
22:35: He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. 
22:36: Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great. 
22:37: Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.
22:38: I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.
22:39: And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.
22:40: For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.
22:41: Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.
22:42: They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
22:43: Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.
22:44: Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.
22:45: Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.
22:46: Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.
22:47: The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.
22:48: It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,
22:49: And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
22:50: Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.
22:51: He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.
23:1: Now these be the last words of David.  David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,
23:2: The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.
23:3: The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.
23:4: And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain. 
23:5: Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.
23:6: But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands: 
23:7: But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place. 
23:8: These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
23:9: And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:
23:10: He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.
23:11: And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite.  And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.
23:12: But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.
23:13: And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.
23:14: And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
23:15: And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
23:16: And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.
23:17: And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?  therefore he would not drink it.  These things did these three mighty men.
23:18: And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three.  And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.
23:19: Was he not most honourable of three?  therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.
23:20: And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:
23:21: And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
23:22: These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.
23:23: He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three.  And David set him over his guard.
23:24: Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
23:25: Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
23:26: Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
23:27: Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 
23:28: Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
23:29: Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, 
23:30: Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash, 
23:31: Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
23:32: Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
23:33: Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,
23:34: Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
23:35: Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
23:36: Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
23:37: Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
23:38: Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,
23:39: Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.
24:1: And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.
24:2: For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.
24:3: And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?
24:4: Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host.  And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
24:5: And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:
24:6: Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon,
24:7: And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hibites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beer-sheba.
24:8: So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
24:9: And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
24:10: And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people.  And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly. 
24:11: For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
24:12: Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee. 
24:13: So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land?  or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee?  or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land?  now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
24:14: And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.
24:15: So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.
24:16: And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand.  And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.
24:17: And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done?  let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house. 
24:18: And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.
24:19: And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded. 
24:20: And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground. 
24:21: And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant?  And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
24:22: And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.
24:23: All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king.  And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.
24:24: And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing.  So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
24:25: And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.  So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
