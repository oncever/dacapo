 1:9: Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.
 1:10: If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:
 1:11: For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.
 1:12: Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.
 1:13: The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
