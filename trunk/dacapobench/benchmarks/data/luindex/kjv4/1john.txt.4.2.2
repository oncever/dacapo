 3:13: Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
 3:14: We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.
 3:15: Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
 3:16: Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
 3:17: But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
 3:18: My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.
 3:19: And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
 3:20: For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
 3:21: Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.
 3:22: And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
 3:23: And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.
 3:24: And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.
 4:1: Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
 4:2: Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:
 4:3: And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.
 4:4: Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.
 4:5: They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.
 4:6: We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
 4:7: Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
 4:8: He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
 4:9: In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
 4:10: Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
 4:11: Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
 4:12: No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
 4:13: Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
 4:14: And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
 4:15: Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
 4:16: And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.
 4:17: Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.
 4:18: There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
 4:19: We love him, because he first loved us.
 4:20: If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?
 4:21: And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.
 5:1: Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.
 5:2: By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.
 5:3: For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.
 5:4: For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.
 5:5: Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
 5:6: This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.
 5:7: For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
 5:8: And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.
 5:9: If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.
 5:10: He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
 5:11: And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
 5:12: He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
 5:13: These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
 5:14: And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:
 5:15: And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.
 5:16: If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.
 5:17: All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
 5:18: We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.
 5:19: And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.
