FIRST KINGS
1:1: Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.
1:2: Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat. 
1:3: So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
1:4: And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not. 
1:5: Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. 
1:6: And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so?  and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.
1:7: And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.
1:8: But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
1:9: And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:
1:10: But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
1:11: Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?
1:12: Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
1:13: Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?  why then doth Adonijah reign?
1:14: Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
1:15: And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.
1:16: And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king.  And the king said, What wouldest thou?
1:17: And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
1:18: And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:
1:19: And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
1:20: And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
1:21: Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
1:22: And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
1:23: And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet.  And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
1:24: And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
1:25: For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah. 
1:26: But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
1:27: Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him? 
1:28: Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba.  And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king. 
1:29: And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,
1:30: Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.
1:31: Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
1:32: And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.  And they came before the king.
1:33: The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:
1:34: And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.
1:35: Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
1:36: And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.
1:37: As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
1:38: So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.
1:39: And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon.  And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.
1:40: And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
1:41: And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating.  And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?
1:42: And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.
1:43: And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.
1:44: And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:
1:45: And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again.  This is the noise that ye have heard.
1:46: And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
1:47: And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne.  And the king bowed himself upon the bed.
1:48: And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it. 
1:49: And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.
1:50: And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 
1:51: And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword. 
1:52: And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
1:53: So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.  And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.
2:1: Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
2:2: I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;
2:3: And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:
2:4: That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
2:5: Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.
2:6: Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.
2:7: But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.
2:8: And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
2:9: Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.
2:10: So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
2:11: And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
2:12: Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
2:13: And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon.  And she said, Comest thou peaceably?  And he said, Peaceably.
2:14: He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee.  And she said, Say on.
2:15: And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.
2:16: And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not.  And she said unto him, Say on.
2:17: And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife. 
2:18: And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.
2:19: Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah.  And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 
2:20: Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay.  And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.
2:21: And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.
2:22: And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah?  ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
2:23: Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.
2:24: Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day. 
2:25: And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.
2:26: And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted. 
2:27: So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. 
2:28: Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom.  And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
2:29: And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar.  Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
2:30: And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth.  And he said, Nay; but I will die here.  And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
2:31: And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.
2:32: And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
2:33: Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.
2:34: So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
2:35: And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
2:36: And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.
2:37: For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.
2:38: And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do.  And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
2:39: And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath.  And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.
2:40: And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.
2:41: And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.
2:42: And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any wither, that thou shalt surely die?  and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.
2:43: Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?
2:44: The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;
2:45: And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.
2:46: So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died.  And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
3:1: And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
3:2: Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days. 
3:3: And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places. 
3:4: And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
3:5: In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
3:6: And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.
3:7: And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.
3:8: And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
3:9: Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?
3:10: And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
3:11: And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;
3:12: Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
3:13: And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.
3:14: And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.
3:15: And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream.  And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
3:16: Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.
3:17: And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
3:18: And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
3:19: And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
3:20: And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
3:21: And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.
3:22: And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son.  And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son.  Thus they spake before the king.
3:23: Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living. 
3:24: And the king said, Bring me a sword.  And they brought a sword before the king.
3:25: And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. 
3:26: Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it.  But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it. 
3:27: Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.
3:28: And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.
4:1: So king Solomon was king over all Israel.
4:2: And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,
4:3: Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.
4:4: And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:
4:5: And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:
4:6: And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.
4:7: And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.
4:8: And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:
4:9: The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan:
4:10: The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:
4:11: The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
4:12: Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:
4:13: The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars:
4:14: Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:
4:15: Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
4:16: Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:
4:17: Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: 
4:18: Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:
4:19: Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land. 
4:20: Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. 
4:21: And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
4:22: And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,
4:23: Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.
4:24: For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.
4:25: And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon. 
4:26: And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
4:27: And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. 
4:28: Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge. 
4:29: And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.
4:30: And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
4:31: For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.
4:32: And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.
4:33: And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.
4:34: And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.
5:1: And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
5:2: And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
5:3: Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
5:4: But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.
5:5: And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.
5:6: Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.
5:7: And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.
5:8: And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
5:9: My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
5:10: So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.
5:11: And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
5:12: And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
5:13: And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. 
5:14: And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.
5:15: And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; 
5:16: Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work. 
5:17: And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.
5:18: And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.
6:1: And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.
6:2: And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.
6:3: And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.
6:4: And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
6:5: And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:
6:6: The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
6:7: And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
6:8: The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.
6:9: So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.
6:10: And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
6:11: And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,
6:12: Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:
6:13: And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
6:14: So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
6:15: And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.
6:16: And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.
6:17: And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long. 
6:18: And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
6:19: And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD. 
6:20: And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar. 
6:21: So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.
6:22: And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.
6:23: And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.
6:24: And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
6:25: And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.
6:26: The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.
6:27: And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
6:28: And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
6:29: And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.
6:30: And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
6:31: And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.
6:32: The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.
6:33: So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.
6:34: And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
6:35: And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.
6:36: And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.
6:37: In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:
6:38: And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it.  So was he seven years in building it.
7:1: But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house. 
7:2: He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
7:3: And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row. 
7:4: And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks. 
7:5: And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.
7:6: And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.
7:7: Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.
7:8: And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work.  Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.
7:9: All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.
7:10: And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
7:11: And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.
7:12: And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house. 
7:13: And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
7:14: He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass.  And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work. 
7:15: For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about. 
7:16: And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:
7:17: And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.
7:18: And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.
7:19: And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.
7:20: And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.
7:21: And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and he called the name thereof Boaz.
7:22: And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
7:23: And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
7:24: And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.
7:25: It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
7:26: And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.
7:27: And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.
7:28: And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:
7:29: And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.
7:30: And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.
7:31: And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.
7:32: And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half a cubit.
7:33: And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.
7:34: And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.
7:35: And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same. 
7:36: For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.
7:37: After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size. 
7:38: Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver. 
7:39: And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.
7:40: And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons.  So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:
7:41: The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;
7:42: And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;
7:43: And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
7:44: And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
7:45: And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.
7:46: In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.
7:47: And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.
7:48: And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,
7:49: And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,
7:50: And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.
7:51: So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD.  And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.
8:1: Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
8:2: And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
8:3: And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
8:4: And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.
8:5: And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
8:6: And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims. 
8:7: For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
8:8: And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day. 
8:9: There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. 
8:10: And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,
8:11: So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.
8:12: Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in thick darkness.
8:13: I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.
8:14: And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)
8:15: And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,
8:16: Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
8:17: And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
8:18: And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.
8:19: Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.
8:20: And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
8:21: And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
8:22: And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:
8:23: And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:
8:24: Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.
8:25: Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.
8:26: And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.
8:27: But will God indeed dwell on the earth?  behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?
8:28: Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:
8:29: That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place.
8:30: And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.
8:31: If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:
8:32: Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
8:33: When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house: 
8:34: Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.
8:35: When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: 
8:36: Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. 
8:37: If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;
8:38: What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:
8:39: Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)
8:40: That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
8:41: Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;
8:42: (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;
8:43: Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.
8:44: If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name:
8:45: Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
8:46: If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;
8:47: Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;
8:48: And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:
8:49: Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,
8:50: And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:
8:51: For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:
8:52: That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.
8:53: For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.
8:54: And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.
8:55: And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
8:56: Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant. 
8:57: The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:
8:58: That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers. 
8:59: And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require: 
8:60: That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.
8:61: Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
8:62: And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.
8:63: And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep.  So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.
8:64: The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.
8:65: And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.
8:66: On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.
9:1: And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,
9:2: That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.
9:3: And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.
9:4: And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:
9:5: Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.
9:6: But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:
9:7: Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:
9:8: And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?
9:9: And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.
9:10: And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,
9:11: (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
9:12: And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not. 
9:13: And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother?  And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.
9:14: And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold. 
9:15: And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer. 
9:16: For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.
9:17: And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,
9:18: and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,
9:19: And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
9:20: And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,
9:21: Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.
9:22: But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.
9:23: These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.
9:24: But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.
9:25: And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD.  So he finished the house.
9:26: And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.
9:27: And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
9:28: And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
10:1: And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.
10:2: And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
10:3: And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.
10:4: And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,
10:5: And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her. 
10:6: And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
10:7: Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard. 
10:8: Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom. 
10:9: Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.
10:10: And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
10:11: And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.
10:12: And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.
10:13: And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty.  So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.
10:14: Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold.
10:15: Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
10:16: And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.
10:17: And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
10:18: Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.
10:19: The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.
10:20: And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
10:21: And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
10:22: For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
10:23: So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
10:24: And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
10:25: And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
10:26: And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.
10:27: And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.
10:28: And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 
10:29: And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
11:1: But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites; 
11:2: Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.
11:3: And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.
11:4: For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.
11:5: For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
11:6: And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father.
11:7: Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.
11:8: And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.
11:9: And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,
11:10: And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.
11:11: Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
11:12: Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
11:13: Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
11:14: And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.
11:15: For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;
11:16: (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)
