21:26: And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.
21:27: And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.
21:28: At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
21:29: For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.
21:30: But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
22:1: Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.
22:2: And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.
22:3: And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;
22:4: Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.
22:5: And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it.  So David prepared abundantly before his death.
22:6: Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel.
22:7: And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:
22:8: But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.
22:9: Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.
22:10: He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever. 
22:11: Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.
22:12: Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God. 
22:13: Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed. 
22:14: Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.
22:15: Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.
22:16: Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number.  Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.
22:17: David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
22:18: Is not the LORD your God with you?  and hath he not given you rest on every side?  for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.
22:19: Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.
23:1: So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel
23:2: And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
23:3: Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.
23:4: Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:
23:5: Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.
23:6: And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
23:7: Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.
23:8: The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
23:9: The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three.  These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.
23:10: And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah.  These four were the sons of Shimei.
23:11: And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house.
23:12: The sons of Kohath; Amram, Ishar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
23:13: The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever. 
23:14: Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.
23:15: The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer. 
23:16: Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief. 
23:17: And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief.  And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
23:18: Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.
23:19: Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
23:20: Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah the first, and Jesiah the second.
23:21: The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi.  The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.
23:22: And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.
23:23: The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
23:24: These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.
23:25: For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:
23:26: And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.
23:27: For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:
23:28: Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;
23:29: Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;
23:30: And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even;
23:31: And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD:
23:32: And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.
24:1: Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron.  The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
24:2: But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Elezar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.
24:3: And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service. 
24:4: And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided.  Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers.
24:5: Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. 
24:6: And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar. 
24:7: Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
24:8: The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,

24:18: The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.
24:19: These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him. 
24:20: And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.

24:30: The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth.  These were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.
24:31: These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.
25:1: Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:
25:2: Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied according to the order of the king.
25:3: Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise the LORD.

25:5: All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn.  And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
25:6: All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.
25:7: So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that were cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight.

27:24: Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.

28:2: Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:
28:3: But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood.
28:4: Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel:
28:5: And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.
28:6: And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
28:7: Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.
28:8: Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.
28:9: And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.
28:10: Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it. 
28:11: Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,
28:12: And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things: 
28:13: Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD. 
28:14: He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:
28:15: Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.
28:16: And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:
28:17: Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver:
28:18: And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
28:19: All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.
28:20: And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.
28:21: And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.
29:1: Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.
29:2: Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
29:3: Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,
29:4: Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal:
29:5: The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers.  And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?
29:6: Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,
29:7: And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
29:8: And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
29:9: Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
29:10: Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.
29:11: Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all. 
29:12: Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.
29:13: Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name. 
29:14: But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort?  for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee. 
29:15: For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.
29:16: O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own.
29:17: I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness.  As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.
29:18: O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:
29:19: And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.
29:20: And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God.  And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.
29:21: And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:
29:22: And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness.  And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.
29:23: Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
29:24: And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.
29:25: And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
29:26: Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
29:27: And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
29:28: And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
29:29: Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,
29:30: With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
