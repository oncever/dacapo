<h1>Metrics</h1>
This page describes the metrics and resulting graphs used to analyse
the DaCapo benchmarks.
<h2>Global metrics</h2>
Global statistics are single numbers that serve to describe some aspect
of a benchmark.  Statistics that describe a peak value are measured at
intervals of various sizes, but  with between 100 and 200 intervals
over the run of a benchmark.

<h1>Pointer metrics</h1>
The pointer metrics measure the reference behaviour of the benchmark,
by looking at how objects point to each other.  Objects are identified
by their position in a 'perfect' heap, ie a heap in which objects are
allocated contiguously, and is compacted whenever an object becomes 
unreachable.  In practice, we use an approximation to this, described
under <a href="methodology.html">methodology</a>.
<p>
Pointer distance refers to the distance (measured in terms of the 
perfect heap abstraction) between an object and the object that one
of its pointers refers to.  This is a signed quantity, and is graphed
on a logarithmic scale.  Positive values are pointers from old objects
to young objects, and negative values are young-to-old pointers. 
<p>
Pointer statistics are measured in two different ways: continuously,
through a write barrier (pointer mutation statistics); 
and statically, by the garbage collector (snapshot statistics).
<h2 id=pointer-distance>Pointer distance</h2>
Pointer distance measures the distance in a "perfect" heap between
the position of an object and the object it points to.  Positive numbers
are older objects pointing to younger objects. 
<p>
A bar in the pointer distance histogram indicates the proportion
of pointers that reached the given distance, summed over the
complete run of the benchmark.  A line in the time-series graph
tracks the proportion of pointers of a given distance or less
at any point of time over the run of the program.
<h2 id=pointer-source>Pointer source</h2>
Pointer source measures where objects that contain pointers are located
in the heap.
<h2 id=pointer-target>Pointer target</h2>
Pointer target measures where objects that are pointed to are located
in the heap.

<h1>Object size metrics</h1>

This class of metrics looks at the distribution of object sizes.  The distribution
is measured in two ways: at the time of allocation, measuring how many objects 
of a given size were actually allocated; and via the garbage collector (run at
regular frequent intervals), measuring the distribution of live objects in the heap.
The difference between these two measurement methods indicates how short- or long-lived
objects of a particular size are.
<p>
Objects are divided into two classes, scalars and arrays.  Results reported as 'object'
statistics include both classes.
<p>
Statistics are graphed as histograms (behaviour summarised over the whole program run)
and time-series graphs, where a line on the graph corresponds to a column in the 
histogram.

<h2 id=object-size-alloc>Allocated object sizes</h2>
  The distribution of object sizes at time of allocation.
<h2 id=object-size-live>Live object sizes</h2>
  The distribution of object sizes as measured by the garbage collector
  at regular(frequent) intervals.
<h2 id=array-size-alloc>Allocated array sizes</h2>
  The distribution of array sizes at time of allocation
<h2 id=array-size-live>Live array sizes</h2>
  The distribution of array sizes as measured by the garbage collector
  at regular(frequent) intervals.
<h2 id=scalar-size-alloc>Allocated scalar object sizes</h2>
  The distribution of scalar (non-array) object sizes at time of allocation
<h2 id=scalar-size-live>Live scalar object sizes</h2>
  The distribution of scalar (non-array) object sizes as measured by the garbage collector
  at regular(frequent) intervals.

<h1>Object pointer metrics</h1>

This class of metrics looks at the distribution of  
pointer fields in objects. The distribution
is measured in two ways: at the time of allocation, measuring how many objects 
with a given number of pointers were actually allocated; and via the garbage collector (run at
regular frequent intervals), measuring the distribution of live objects 
with a given number of pointer fields in the heap.
The difference between these two measurement methods indicates how short- or long-lived
objects with a given number of pointers are.

<h2 id=scalar-ptrs-alloc>Pointers in allocated scalar objects</h2>
  The distribution of pointer fields in scalar objects at time of allocation.
<h2 id=scalar-ptrs-live>Pointers in live scalar objects</h2>
  The distribution of pointer fields in scalar objects that are live in the heap (as 
  measured by the garbage collector).
<h2 id=array-ptrs-alloc>Pointers in allocated array objects</h2>
  The distribution of pointer fields in array objects at time of allocation.
<h2 id=array-ptrs-live>Pointers in live array objects</h2>
  The distribution of pointer fields in array objects that are live in the heap (as 
  measured by the garbage collector).

<h1>Heap composition</h1>

These graphs track the composition of the heap by grouping allocated objects into <i>cohorts</i>,
objects allocated within a particular period of time.  For these statistics we choose a cohort size
in bytes (eg 8mb), and group objects accordingly.  The measurement process 
performs frequent garbage collections, and at each collection it records the 
volume of live objects in each cohort.  The resulting graphs draw one line for each
cohort, tracking its survival rate over time.
<p>
Two styles of graph are shown, standard (where the top line of the graph is the oldest cohort),
and inverted (the oldest cohort is at the bottom).
<p>
The x-axis of the graph is given in either allocations or mutations.

<h2 id=heap-comp>Heap composition</h2>
  Composition  of the heap, one line per cohort, indicating how much data from
  each allocation cohort is live at the given time.
