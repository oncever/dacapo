<h1>Metrics</h1>
This page describes the metrics and resulting graphs used to analyse
the DaCapo benchmarks.
<h2>Global metrics</h2>
Global statistics are single numbers that serve to describe some aspect
of a benchmark.  Statistics that describe a peak value are measured at
intervals of various sizes, but  with between 100 and 200 intervals
over the run of a benchmark.

<h1>Pointer metrics</h1>
The pointer metrics measure the reference behaviour of the benchmark,
by looking at how objects point to each other.  Objects are identified
by their position in a 'perfect' heap, ie a heap in which objects are
allocated contiguously, and is compacted whenever an object becomes 
unreachable.  In practice, we use an approximation to this, described
under <a href="methodology.html">methodology</a>.
<p>
Pointer distance refers to the distance (measured in terms of the 
perfect heap abstraction) between an object and the object that one
of its pointers refers to.  This is a signed quantity, and is graphed
on a logarithmic scale.  Positive values are pointers from old objects
to young objects, and negative values are young-to-old pointers. 
<p>
Pointer statistics are measured in two different ways: continuously,
through a write barrier (pointer mutation statistics); 
and statically, by the garbage collector (snapshot statistics).
<h2 id=pointer-distance>Pointer distance</h2>
Pointer distance measures the distance in a "perfect" heap between
the position of an object and the object it points to.  Positive numbers
are older objects pointing to younger objects. 
<p>
A bar in the pointer distance histogram indicates the proportion
of pointers that reached the given distance, summed over the
complete run of the benchmark.  A line in the time-series graph
tracks the proportion of pointers of a given distance or less
at any point of time over the run of the program.
<h2 id=pointer-source>Pointer source</h2>
Pointer source measures where objects that contain pointers are located
in the heap.
<h2 id=pointer-target>Pointer target</h2>
Pointer target measures where objects that are pointed to are located
in the heap.
