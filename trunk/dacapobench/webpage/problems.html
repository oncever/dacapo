  <title>The DaCapo Benchmark Suite</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>Known Problems</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The 'chart' benchmark will not run on VMs which use GNU Classpath 0.91 or earlier.<p>
  </li>
  <li>The 'eclipse' benchmark requires a regular jre in order to be able to perform its build tasks (it does needs to be able to compile against standard libraries).  Some JVMs do not comply with eclipse's expectations.  A simple work-around is to specify a jre for eclipse to compile against.  If the jvm used to run the benchmarks does not comply with eclipse's expectations, an error message will be produced with an explanation of the suggested work around (setting -Declipse.java.home=xxx on the command line).<p>
  </li>
  <li>The benchmarks run with the Sun jdk 1.4 and 1.5, but do not build with
      1.5.  This is a limitation of some of the benchmarks themselves.<p>
  </li>
  <li>
The jar file contains the compiled classes for the benchmark programs, plus
the minimum library jar file contents required to get the benchmarks to run.
<p>
If the system class libraries for your VM are missing classes distributed 
as library jar files with the benchmark, please let us know so we can amend
the build procedure.  After building with ant, the source tree for each 
benchmark is left in the build_src subdirectory, and comparing the library
jar files distributed with the benchmark and the dacapo build.xml might 
provide the answer.<p>
  </li>
  <li>There are some issues with JikesRVM.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>By default, JikesRVM does not build classpath with support for
AWT, which
<span style="font-style: italic;">batik</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">chart</span> use. Jikes can be configured
to use AWT, by editing <span style="font-family: monospace;">rvm/bin/jBuildClasspathJar</span>,
in particular, ensuring that the <span style="font-family: monospace;">--disable-gtk-peer</span>
argument is <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>set when
classpath is built (ie you want the gtk-peer enabled).
<p>
</li>
    <li>Version beta041020 did not include sufficient classes for Jikes
RVM to run xalan.&nbsp; This is fixed in subsequent releases.<br>
    </li>
